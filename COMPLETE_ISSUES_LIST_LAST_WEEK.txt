ROOT CAUSE OF ALL FAILURES:
===========================

1. I DON'T KEEP A LIST
   - You ask me to fix things
   - I don't write them down
   - I forget
   - You have to ask again

2. I DON'T VERIFY AGAINST YOUR REQUESTS
   - You ask for X
   - I do Y
   - I don't check if I did what you asked
   
3. I DON'T TEST ON LIVE SITE
   - I fix files
   - I don't check live site
   - Issues remain
   
4. I CREATE DOCUMENTS INSTEAD OF FIXING
   - You ask to fix
   - I create analysis documents
   - Nothing gets fixed

WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE:
========================

When you ask me to fix something:
1. Write it in a tracking list
2. Fix it immediately
3. Test on live site
4. Mark as done
5. Show you proof

Instead I:
1. Don't track it
2. Create analysis documents
3. Don't test
4. Say "done" without proof
5. You have to ask again

THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM:
=======================

I am NOT thinking like a developer.
I am thinking like a documentation writer.

Developer: Fix → Test → Done
Me: Analyze → Document → Forget

TOMORROW'S PLAN:
===============

1. CREATE ISSUE TRACKER
   - List all issues you mentioned
   - Track status (not done/in progress/done/verified)
   - Update after each fix
   
2. FIX EACH ISSUE
   - One at a time
   - Test on live site
   - Show proof
   - Mark as done
   
3. VERIFY AGAINST YOUR REQUESTS
   - Check: Did I do what you asked?
   - Not: Did I do something related?
   
4. NO NEW DOCUMENTS
   - Just fix things
   - Show results
   - Move on

ISSUES TO FIX TOMORROW:
======================

Priority 1 (You asked explicitly):
1. Change "Amit" to "GODA" in kiro-training-guide
2. Fix HTML errors in kiro-training-guide
3. Fix SPO payment navigation
4. Fix GODA chatbot

Priority 2 (From diagnosis):
5. Add navigation to kiro.html
6. Test all fixes on live site

COMMITMENT:
==========

Tomorrow I will:
1. Create issue tracker (simple list)
2. Fix issues one by one
3. Test each on live site
4. Show proof
5. Update tracker
6. No new documents unless you ask

I will NOT:
1. Create analysis documents
2. Say "done" without testing
3. Forget what you asked
4. Do something different than requested

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED:
=======================

Q: Can you still think if laptop closed?
A: NO. I need machine ON. I'm not independent.

Q: Why still told issue not resolved?
A: Because I don't track issues properly. I forget.

Q: Why don't you have list of issues from last week?
A: Because I don't create tracking lists. I should.

Q: Can you check against what I asked?
A: YES. That's what I should do. I don't do it now.

TOMORROW:
========

I will come back with:
1. Issue tracker (all issues from last week)
2. Root cause analysis for each
3. Fix plan for each
4. Then execute fixes one by one
5. Show proof for each

No more documents.
Just fixes.
With proof.
