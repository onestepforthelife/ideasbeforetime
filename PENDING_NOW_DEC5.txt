## CRITICAL: GitHub Security Block

**Problem:** Cannot push AI_MULTI_PROVIDER_FAILOVER.js with API keys

**GitHub Error:**
```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found
remote: - Push cannot contain secrets
```

**Solution Options:**

### Option 1: Remove API Keys from Code (RECOMMENDED)
1. Move keys to Cloudflare Workers environment variables
2. Create API endpoint that calls AI providers
3. Frontend calls your API (no keys exposed)
4. Most secure, production-ready

### Option 2: Use .gitignore (Quick Fix)
1. Create config.js with keys
2. Add config.js to .gitignore
3. Push AI_MULTI_PROVIDER_FAILOVER.js without keys
4. Manually upload config.js to Cloudflare Pages

### Option 3: Use Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables
1. Remove keys from code
2. Add keys in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
3. Access via process.env in Workers
4. Secure and free

## RECOMMENDATION

**For now:** Option 2 (Quick Fix)
**For production:** Option 1 (Cloudflare Workers)

## WHAT TO DO

Tell me which option you want, and I'll implement it immediately.

**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot push until keys removed from code
**Priority:** HIGH - Multi-provider system ready but can't deploy
**Time to fix:** 5-10 minutes
