## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### AdSense vs Google Ads

### Both Work Together
- AdSense earns you money from visitors
- Google Ads brings you more visitors
- Net effect: More traffic, more conversions, more revenue

### Quality Score Matters
- Your site is already optimized for high quality score
- Fast loading, mobile-friendly, good content
- This means lower cost per click (CPC)
