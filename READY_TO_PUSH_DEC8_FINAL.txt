HOW TO PUSH:
============

Method 1: GitHub Desktop (Recommended)
---------------------------------------
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You'll see 2 changed files:
   - astronomy.html
   - _redirects

2. Done!

AFTER PUSH:
===========
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Cloudflare deployment
2. Purge Cloudflare cache:
   - Dashboard → Caching → Purge Everything
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for cache propagation
4. Test these URLs:
   - https://onestepforthelife.com/astronomy (should have gray borders)
   - https://onestepforthelife.com/kiro-training-guide (should redirect to kiro-improvement-guide)

VERIFICATION:
=============
After cache propagation, all pages should have:
✅ Gray gradient backgrounds (#5a6c7d to #8b9aa7)
✅ No purple colors (#667eea, #764ba2)
✅ Deleted pages redirect properly (301)

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
==================
Before this fix:
- 95% of pages deployed successfully ✅
- 1 page had purple (astronomy.html) ❌
- 1 deleted page still accessible ❌

After this fix:
