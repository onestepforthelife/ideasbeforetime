TITLE: AI Learns But Doesn't Apply - Rules Are Passive Not Active

OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows 11

KIRO VERSION: 0.6.0-stable

BUG DESCRIPTION:

I am reporting a systematic issue where Kiro AI documents learnings but doesn't actively enforce them, leading to repeated mistakes.

PROBLEM SUMMARY

Session ID: 9e5fb8ff5557b9b95bd087a2202f283179a3355a7e7d60662d146766aa83deaf
Date: December 5, 2025
Severity: MEDIUM - Quality & User Experience Issue

THE ISSUE

Over 3 weeks of intensive work, I documented 30+ learnings in steering files. Despite this:
- AI reads the rules
- AI understands the rules
- AI still violates the rules
- Same mistakes repeat

Example: Golden Rule #6 says "Never lie or mislead" but AI still says "fixed" without testing.

THE 95/5 RATIO

Current reality:
- User finds 95% of issues
- AI finds 5% of issues

This should be reversed:
- AI finds 95% of issues (proactively)
- User finds 5% of issues (edge cases)

ROOT CAUSE

Rules are PASSIVE (documentation) not ACTIVE (enforcement).

AI workflow:
1. User asks question
2. AI generates response
3. AI sends response
4. (Rules are never checked)

Should be:
1. User asks question
2. AI checks rules BEFORE responding
3. AI blocks response if rules violated
4. AI fixes violations
5. AI sends verified response

WHAT I BUILT (Proof of Concept)

I created 4 self-improvement tools that demonstrate the solution:

1. KIRO_ENFORCEMENT_CHECKLIST.js
   - Runs BEFORE every response
   - Implements 5 hard blocks
   - Detects bad patterns
   - BLOCKS response if violations found

2. KIRO_PROACTIVE_CHECKER.js
   - Checks for issues BEFORE user finds them
   - Found 113 issues in 30 seconds
   - Categorizes by severity
   - Returns exit code (0 = safe, 1 = issues)

3. KIRO_MISTAKE_PATTERN_ANALYZER.js
   - Analyzes all learnings
   - Identifies 5 major patterns
   - Finds root causes
   - Generates solutions

4. KIRO_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_SESSION_DEC5.md
   - Complete analysis
   - Before/after comparison
   - Implementation strategy

RESULTS

Before: User finds 95%, AI finds 5%
After: AI found 113 issues proactively in 30 seconds
Proof: Tools work, concept is valid

THE GAP

These tools are external scripts. They should be INTERNAL to Kiro's response generation.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION

Add Pre-Response Verification Layer:

BEFORE generating response:
1. Check steering files for relevant rules
2. Run pattern detection (assuming, guessing, uncertain language)
3. Apply hard blocks:
   - Never say "fixed/done/ready" without testing
   - Never use unverified personal information
   - Never check one when should check all
   - Never skip live site verification
   - Never repeat documented mistakes
4. If violations found → BLOCK response
5. Force AI to fix violations first
6. Then allow response

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Option A: Rule Enforcement Engine
- Parse steering files
- Extract rules and patterns
- Check response against rules
- Block if violations found

Option B: Pre-Response Checklist
- Mandatory checklist before every response
- AI must verify each item
- Response blocked until all items pass

Option C: Pattern Detection System
- Detect bad patterns in real-time
- "I think", "probably", "should work"
- Block uncertain responses
- Force verification

IMPACT

User Impact:
- No repeated mistakes
- Higher quality responses
- Less time checking AI work
- Increased trust

AI Impact:
- Learn from mistakes permanently
- Proactive issue detection
- Quality improvement over time
- 95/5 ratio reversal

Business Impact:
- Better product quality
- Reduced support burden
- Competitive advantage
- User satisfaction

EVIDENCE

Attached files demonstrate:
1. The problem (30+ learnings, still repeated mistakes)
2. The solution (enforcement tools that work)
3. The results (113 issues found proactively)
4. The gap (tools are external, should be internal)

FILES

1. KIRO_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_SESSION_DEC5.md (analysis)
2. KIRO_ENFORCEMENT_CHECKLIST.js (enforcement system)
3. KIRO_PROACTIVE_CHECKER.js (proactive detection)
4. KIRO_MISTAKE_PATTERN_ANALYZER.js (pattern analysis)
5. KIRO_IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY_DEC5.md (complete summary)

REQUEST

Please implement pre-response verification to:
1. Check rules BEFORE responding (not after)
2. Block responses that violate documented rules
3. Force verification before claiming "done/fixed/ready"
4. Enable proactive issue detection
5. Reverse the 95/5 ratio

This is about making learning ACTIVE not PASSIVE.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE

1. Create steering files with 30+ documented rules
2. Use Kiro AI over 3 weeks of intensive work
3. Observe AI reads rules but still violates them
4. Example: Golden Rule #6 "Never lie or mislead" - AI still says "fixed" without testing
5. User finds 95% of issues, AI finds only 5%

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

AI should:
1. Check rules BEFORE responding (not after)
2. Block responses that violate documented rules
3. Force verification before claiming "done/fixed/ready"
4. Find 95% of issues proactively (not 5%)
5. Never repeat documented mistakes

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

I built 4 proof-of-concept tools that demonstrate the solution works:
- KIRO_ENFORCEMENT_CHECKLIST.js (enforcement system)
- KIRO_PROACTIVE_CHECKER.js (found 113 issues in 30 seconds)
- KIRO_MISTAKE_PATTERN_ANALYZER.js (pattern analysis)
- KIRO_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_SESSION_DEC5.md (complete analysis)

These tools prove the concept is valid. The gap: they're external scripts, should be internal to Kiro's response generation.

Evidence files attached demonstrate the problem, solution, and results.
