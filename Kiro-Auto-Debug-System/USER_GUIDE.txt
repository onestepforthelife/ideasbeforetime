1. WHAT IS THIS?
========================================

The Kiro Auto-Debug System is a collection of automated tools that fix common Kiro IDE errors without manual intervention.

Instead of:
- Manually clearing caches
- Searching for error solutions
- Reinstalling Kiro
- Losing your settings

You can:
- Run one script
- Get automatic diagnosis
- Apply proven fixes
- Keep working

========================================
2. WHICH VERSION SHOULD I USE?
========================================

BAT VERSION (Recommended for most users):
✅ Works on all Windows versions
✅ No special permissions needed
✅ Double-click to run
✅ Easier for beginners

Location: bat-version folder

PS1 VERSION (Advanced users):

Both versions do the same thing!
