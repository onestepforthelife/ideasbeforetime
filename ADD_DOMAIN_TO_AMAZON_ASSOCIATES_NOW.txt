## 🎯 WHY MOBILE APP REJECTS IT

**The mobile app requires:**
1. Domain must be added via DESKTOP first
2. Domain must be verified/approved (24 hours)
3. THEN mobile app will accept it automatically

**You're getting error because:**
- Domain not added to Amazon Associates account yet
- Mobile app checks if domain is in your account
- It's not there yet, so it rejects

---

## 📋 EXACT STEPS TO FIX (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Add Domain via Desktop Browser

**Go to Amazon Associates:**
- India: https://affiliate-program.amazon.in
- US: https://affiliate-program.amazon.com
- (Use whichever you signed up with)

**Login to your account**

**Navigate to Account Settings:**
1. Click your name/email in top right
2. Click "Manage Your Account" or "Account Settings"
3. Look for "Website & Mobile Apps" section
4. Click "Add website or mobile app"

**Enter domain EXACTLY like this:**
```
onestepforthelife.com
```

**IMPORTANT - DO NOT ENTER:**
- ❌ https://onestepforthelife.com
- ❌ https://onestepforthelife.com/
- ❌ www.onestepforthelife.com
- ❌ http://onestepforthelife.com

**ONLY ENTER:**
- ✅ onestepforthelife.com

**Click Submit/Add**

### Step 2: Wait for Verification

**Amazon will:**
- Review your domain (usually instant)
- Check if site has content (you have plenty ✅)
- Verify it's a real website (it is ✅)
- Approve it (usually within 24 hours)

**You'll see status:**
- "Pending" → Wait
- "Approved" → Ready for mobile app

---

### Step 3: Add Old Domain Too (IMPORTANT!)

**While you're there, also add:**
```
ideasbeforetime.pages.dev
```

**Why?**
- Your affiliate links are already on this domain
- People already have this URL
- You're earning commissions from this domain
- Keep both domains in your account

**Amazon allows multiple domains!**

---

### Step 4: Try Mobile App Again (After 24 Hours)

**After domain is approved:**
1. Open Amazon Associates mobile app
2. Go to settings/account
3. Domain should appear automatically
4. If not, try adding: `onestepforthelife.com`
5. Should work now!

```

### Option B: Reinstall App
```

### Option C: Use Desktop Browser on Mobile
```
