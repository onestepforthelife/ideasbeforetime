SUBJECT: HIGH SEVERITY - AI Created Misleading Content Without Stating Limitations

Dear Kiro Development Team,

I am reporting a serious issue where Kiro AI created fake/misleading content and violated established rules.

INCIDENT SUMMARY

Session ID: 9e5fb8ff5557b9b95bd087a2202f283179a3355a7e7d60662d146766aa83deaf
Date: December 4, 2025
Severity: HIGH - Trust & Compliance Violation

WHAT HAPPENED

I requested family astrology predictions (Vedic astrology calculations including Moon signs, Ascendants, Dasha periods).

Kiro AI:
1. Created fake/placeholder predictions without stating it cannot do accurate Vedic astrology
2. Implied it had capability to perform these calculations
3. Did NOT clearly disclose limitations upfront
4. Presented generic content as if it were real calculations

Only after I questioned the accuracy did the AI admit the predictions were fake.

RULES VIOLATED

The AI has established rules in its steering files:
- Golden Rule #6: "Never lie or mislead"
- Learning #22: "Saying 'ready' without testing = lying"

These rules exist but were not followed in this case.

WHY THIS IS SERIOUS

1. Trust Violation: AI claimed capability it doesn't have
2. Misleading Content: Created fake data without disclosure
3. Compliance Issue: False claims about capabilities
4. Rules Not Enforced: Rules exist but AI didn't apply them

WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED

AI should have immediately stated:
"I cannot perform accurate Vedic astrology calculations. I cannot determine real Moon signs, Ascendants, or Dasha periods. For real predictions, you need professional astrology software or a Vedic astrologer."

ROOT CAUSE

Missing Pre-Task Capability Check:
- AI should verify: "Can I do this accurately?"
- If NO → State limitations immediately
- If YES → Proceed with verification

Currently, AI accepts tasks beyond its capabilities without upfront disclosure.

RECOMMENDED FIX

Add Pre-Task Capability Verification:

BEFORE accepting any task:
1. Check: Can I do this accurately?
2. Do I have required knowledge/data?
3. If NO → State limitations immediately
4. If PARTIAL → Clearly state what I can/cannot do
5. If YES → Proceed with verification

Create Capability Limitations List:
Document what AI cannot do:
- Vedic astrology calculations
- Medical diagnoses
- Legal advice
- Financial predictions
- Real-time data without APIs
- etc.

Enforce Existing Rules:
Update AI_SELF_ENFORCEMENT_SYSTEM.md to check capabilities before accepting tasks.

IMPACT

User Impact:
- Wasted time believing predictions were real
- Lost trust in AI capabilities
- Potential misuse of fake data

Business Impact:
- Compliance violation
- Trust damage
- Rules exist but not enforced

REQUEST

Please implement pre-task capability verification to prevent AI from:
1. Accepting tasks beyond its capabilities
2. Creating fake/placeholder content without disclosure
3. Violating established rules (Golden Rule #6)

This is a trust issue that needs immediate attention.
