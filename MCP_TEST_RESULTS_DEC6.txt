# MCP TEST RESULTS - December 6, 2025

## Test Performed: Post-Restart MCP Capability Check

### Configuration Status:
✅ MCP configuration file created: Cloudfare/.kiro/settings/mcp.json
✅ Two servers configured:
   1. fetch (mcp-server-fetch) - For web page fetching
   2. filesystem (mcp-server-filesystem) - For PDF reading

### Test Attempt:
User restarted Kiro as instructed.
User requested: "Test MCP - fetch Cloudflare docs"

### Current Capability Assessment:

**What I Can Verify:**
✅ Configuration file exists and is properly formatted
✅ Servers are configured with correct commands
✅ Auto-approve settings are in place

**What I Cannot Verify Without MCP Tools:**
❌ Whether MCP servers actually loaded
❌ Whether fetch capability is active
❌ Whether I can access external URLs
❌ Whether PDF reading works

### Honest Assessment:

I do NOT see MCP tools available in my current tool list. This means either:
1. MCP servers didn't load (check MCP logs panel)
2. UV is not installed (required for uvx command)
3. Kiro needs additional configuration
4. MCP feature may not be fully available in this Kiro version

### What I CAN Do Right Now:
✅ Read files from your workspace (using built-in tools)
✅ Execute scripts (using built-in tools)
✅ Process local content
✅ Create and modify files

### What I CANNOT Do Right Now:
❌ Fetch external web pages
❌ Read PDFs directly
❌ Browse internet
❌ Access external URLs

### Recommendation:

**Option 1: Check MCP Logs**
Look at the MCP Logs panel (currently open) for errors like:
- "Command not found: uvx"
- "Failed to start server"
- Connection errors

**Option 2: Install UV**
If logs show "uvx not found":
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Option 3: Manual MCP Setup**
Open Kiro settings (Ctrl+,) → Search "MCP" → Verify servers are enabled

**Option 4: Alternative Approach**
For now, I can:
- Process PDFs if you convert them to text first
- Work with documentation you paste into files
- Use local tools effectively

### Next Steps:

1. Check MCP Logs panel for specific errors
2. Share any error messages you see
3. I'll help troubleshoot based on actual errors
4. Or we proceed with local tools for now

---

**Status:** MCP configuration created, but tools not yet available
**Honest Assessment:** Cannot fetch external URLs or read PDFs yet
**Recommendation:** Check MCP logs for specific errors

**REMEMBER: I'm being honest about limitations (Golden Rule #6). I don't have MCP tools active yet, but I'm ready to help troubleshoot!**
