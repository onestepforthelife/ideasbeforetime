## 🚫 MIXING RULES (NEVER DO THIS)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Discuss GHL SaaS in Ideas website context
- Mix Kiro learning files with business projects
- Put mobile app specs in website folder
- Confuse which project we're working on

✅ **DO:**
- Ask "Which project?" if unclear
- Keep files in correct folders
- Separate conversations by project
- Clear context before starting work

---

## 💬 CONVERSATION PROTOCOL

**When starting ANY discussion:**

**Step 1: Identify Project**
```
User mentions: "website" → Project 1
User mentions: "learning" or "improvement" → Project 2
User mentions: "GHL" or "SaaS" or "mobile app" → Project 3
```

**Step 2: Confirm Context**
```
Me: "Working on [Project Name]. Correct?"
User: Confirms
Me: Proceeds with that project only
```

**Step 3: Stay Focused**
```
- Only discuss that project
- Only reference files from that project
- Only create files in that project folder
- Switch projects only when user explicitly says so
```

## 🎯 CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT

**Active Project:** [TO BE DETERMINED BY USER]

**When user says:**
- "website" or "Ideas Before Time" → Switch to Project 1
- "learning" or "improvement" or "Kiro" → Switch to Project 2
- "GHL" or "SaaS" or "plumbing" or "mobile app" → Switch to Project 3

**I will always confirm before proceeding!**

## ✅ BENEFITS OF SEPARATION

1. **Clear Focus** - No confusion about what we're working on
2. **Organized Files** - Easy to find project-specific files
3. **Efficient Work** - No time wasted on wrong context
4. **Clean Workspace** - Each project has its own space
5. **Easy Handoff** - Can share specific project folders

---

**Status:** ACTIVE - Use this structure always
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Prevents confusion and wasted time
**Rule:** ALWAYS confirm project context before starting work

**REMEMBER: 3 separate projects, 3 separate folders, 3 separate contexts!**
