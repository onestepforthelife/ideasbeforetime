# DEEP ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - December 7, 2025

## THE PROBLEM
- 8 pages showing 308 Permanent Redirect
- Cache purged multiple times - still broken
- This means: NOT a cache issue!

## POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES

### 1. CLOUDFLARE PAGES REDIRECT RULES
**Check:** Workers & Pages → ideasbeforetime → Settings → Redirects
**Look for:** Rules redirecting .html to extensionless URLs
**Example:** `/blog.html` → `/blog` (308)
**Fix:** Remove or modify redirect rules

### 2. DEPLOYMENT FAILURE
**Check:** Workers & Pages → ideasbeforetime → Deployments
**Look for:** Latest deployment status
**Possible issues:**
- Build failed
- Files not uploaded
- Deployment stuck
**Fix:** Redeploy or check build logs

### 3. BUILD ERRORS
**Check:** Latest deployment → View build log
**Look for:** Errors during build
**Common errors:**
- File size too large (>25MB limit)
- Build command failed
- Missing dependencies
**Fix:** Fix build errors, redeploy

### 4. _REDIRECTS FILE
**Check:** Root directory for `_redirects` file
**Look for:** Rules redirecting .html files
**Example:** `/blog.html /blog 308`
**Fix:** Remove or modify _redirects file

### 5. CLOUDFLARE WORKERS
**Check:** Workers & Pages → Workers
**Look for:** Worker intercepting requests
**Possible:** Worker redirecting .html to extensionless
**Fix:** Modify or disable worker

## AMIT NEEDS TO CHECK

### Step 1: Check Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select: ideasbeforetime.pages.dev
3. Click: Deployments
4. Check: Latest deployment status
   - ✅ Success?
   - ❌ Failed?
   - ⏳ In progress?

### Step 2: Check Build Logs
1. Click: Latest deployment
2. Click: View build log
3. Look for: Errors or warnings
4. Screenshot: Send to me if errors found

### Step 3: Check Redirect Rules
1. Click: Settings
2. Click: Redirects (or Functions)
3. Look for: Any rules with .html
4. Screenshot: Send to me

### Step 4: Check _redirects File
1. In GitHub Desktop
2. Check if file exists: `_redirects`
3. If exists, open and show me content

## MY FAILURE

**What I did wrong:**
1. Assumed cache issue without deeper investigation
2. Didn't ask Amit to check build logs
3. Didn't consider other root causes
4. Kept repeating "purge cache" without thinking deeper

**What I should have done:**
1. Ask for build log screenshot
2. Ask for deployment status
3. Check for redirect rules
4. Think about ALL possible causes
5. Not assume cache is always the problem

## LIFETIME SOLUTION

**Before saying "cache issue":**
1. ☐ Check deployment status
2. ☐ Check build logs
3. ☐ Check redirect rules
4. ☐ Check _redirects file
5. ☐ Check Workers
6. ☐ THEN check cache

**This is systematic troubleshooting, not guessing!**
