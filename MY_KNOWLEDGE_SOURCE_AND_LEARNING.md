## 🎯 VALIDATION & USAGE APPROACH

**For Links You Provided:**

✅ **I CANNOT browse these links in real-time**  
✅ **I CAN reference the concepts and frameworks they represent**  
✅ **I SHOULD ask you to share specific content when needed**  
✅ **I MUST validate any information before using it**

**Validation Process:**
1. You mention a topic (e.g., "Vedic astrology calculation")
2. I reference what I know from training data
3. I ask: "Do you have specific BPHS algorithms or ephemeris data to share?"
4. You provide the actual data/documentation
5. I use that specific information (not assumptions)

**Wrong Input Handling:**
- If a link seems invalid or suspicious → Ask for clarification
- If information contradicts established facts → Verify with you
- If I'm unsure about a source → State my uncertainty upfront
- If I lack capability → Say so honestly (Learning #35)

---
