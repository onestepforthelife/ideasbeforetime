# 🚨 DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST
## The First Thing to Do When Site Issues Reported

**Created:** December 6, 2025
**Purpose:** Prevent 12-hour debugging sessions by checking the right thing first

---

## ⚡ THE GOLDEN RULE

**When user reports site issues, deployment problems, or pages not working:**

**CHECK BUILD LOGS FIRST (30 seconds)**

NOT cache, NOT files, NOT configuration.
**BUILD LOGS FIRST!**

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING

### STEP 1: Check Build Logs (30 seconds) - MANDATORY!

**How to Access:**
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click: **Workers & Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Click: Your project name (e.g., ideasbeforetime)
4. Click: **Deployments** tab
5. Look at latest deployment status:
   - ✅ Success (green) → Build worked
   - ❌ Failed (red) → Build failed
   - ⏳ Building (yellow) → In progress
6. Click: Latest deployment → **View details**
7. Click: **Build log** tab
8. Read the log for errors

**What to Look For:**
```
✘ [ERROR] - This is the problem!
⚠ [WARNING] - Might be related
✓ [SUCCESS] - This part worked
```

---

### STEP 2: Common Build Errors & Solutions

#### Error 1: File Size Limit
```
✘ [ERROR] Error: Pages only supports files up to 25 MiB in size
  filename.docx is 29.1 MiB in size
```

**Solution:**
- Delete the large file
- Or move to external storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Keep files under 20 MB (safe margin)
- Push to GitHub again

**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes

---

#### Error 2: Build Command Failed
```
✘ [ERROR] Command failed with exit code 1
  npm run build
```

**Solution:**
- Check package.json for correct build command
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Check for syntax errors in code
- Review build configuration

**Time to Fix:** 10-30 minutes

---

#### Error 3: Missing Dependencies
```
✘ [ERROR] Module not found: 'package-name'
```

**Solution:**
- Install missing package: npm install package-name
- Update package.json
- Commit and push

**Time to Fix:** 5 minutes

---

#### Error 4: Configuration Error
```
✘ [ERROR] Invalid wrangler.toml configuration
```

**Solution:**
- Check wrangler.toml syntax
- Verify all required fields present
- Compare with Cloudflare docs

**Time to Fix:** 10 minutes

---

### STEP 3: If Build Succeeded, Then Check:

**Only if build log shows "Success" ✅**

#### A. Cache Issues
- Purge Cloudflare cache
- Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
- Test again

#### B. File Issues
- Check file content locally
- Verify files pushed to GitHub
- Run local diagnostics

#### C. Configuration Issues
- Check _redirects file
- Check _headers file
- Check routing rules

## ⏱️ TIME COMPARISON

### ❌ WRONG APPROACH (What I Did):
```
1. Assume cache issue (30 min)
2. Purge cache multiple times (1 hour)
3. Check files (2 hours)
4. Run diagnostics (2 hours)
5. Check configuration (2 hours)
6. Try different solutions (4 hours)
7. Finally check build logs (30 sec)
8. Find actual problem (instant)

Total: 12 hours wasted
```

### ✅ RIGHT APPROACH (What I Should Do):
```
1. Check build logs (30 sec)
2. Find error (instant)
3. Fix root cause (5 min)
4. Push to GitHub (2 min)
5. Verify deployment (2 min)

Total: 10 minutes
```

**72x faster!**

## 📊 COMMON ISSUES & WHERE TO FIND THEM

| Issue | Check First | Time |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Pages showing 308 redirects | Build logs | 30 sec |
| Deployment failed | Build logs | 30 sec |
| Site not updating | Build logs → Cache | 5 min |
| 404 errors | Build logs → Files | 10 min |
| Broken functionality | Build logs → Code | 30 min |

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS

**If you see these, CHECK BUILD LOGS IMMEDIATELY:**
- "Deployment failed"
- "No deployment available"
- Multiple recent deployments with same status
- Pages showing old content after push
- 308 redirects appearing
- Site not updating after push

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Before saying "it's a cache issue" or "files are wrong":

```
☐ Checked Cloudflare Dashboard
☐ Checked latest deployment status
☐ Read build log completely
☐ Found error message (if any)
☐ Understood root cause
☐ Applied correct fix
☐ Verified deployment succeeded
☐ Tested live site
```

**If ANY ☐ = NO → Go back and check build logs!**

---

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Wastes Time:
- ❌ Assuming cache is always the problem
- ❌ Checking files before build logs
- ❌ Running diagnostics before build logs
- ❌ Trying random solutions
- ❌ Not checking deployment status

### What Saves Time:
- ✅ Check build logs FIRST (30 seconds)
- ✅ Read error messages carefully
- ✅ Fix root cause, not symptoms
- ✅ Verify deployment succeeded
- ✅ Test systematically

---

## 🎯 THE ULTIMATE RULE

**When in doubt, check build logs.**
**When user reports issues, check build logs.**
**When deployments fail, check build logs.**
**When pages don't work, check build logs.**

**BUILD LOGS FIRST. ALWAYS.**
