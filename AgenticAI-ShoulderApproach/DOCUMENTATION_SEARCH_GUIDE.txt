## 🎯 WHAT WE NEED FROM WORD DOCUMENT

**If Word document contains additional details:**

3. Additional workflows not yet documented
4. Specific technical requirements
5. Implementation timeline details
6. Budget and resource allocation
7. Any other details not in current markdown files

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Without Word Document)

**We can proceed with what we have:**

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Mobile App Specifications
1. Update SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md with mobile app layer
2. Choose tech stack (React Native vs Flutter)
3. Design mobile UI/UX for 3 user types:
   - Technician app
   - Customer app
   - Business owner app
4. Define mobile app features and screens
5. Document mobile-specific integrations

### THEN: Complete Documentation
6. Create 03_GHL_WORKFLOWS/ (5 workflow specs)
7. Create 04_AI_AGENTS/ (3 agent specs)
8. Create 05_INTEGRATIONS/ (3 integration guides)
9. Create 06_IMPLEMENTATION/ (3 phase guides)
10. Create 07_DOCUMENTATION/ (API docs, troubleshooting)
