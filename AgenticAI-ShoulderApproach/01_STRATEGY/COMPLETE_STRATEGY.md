# 📊 COMPLETE AGENTIC AI "SHOULDER APPROACH" STRATEGY

**Created:** December 6, 2025  
**Business:** Drain Cleaning Services  
**Model:** High-Ticket "Shoulder Approach"

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

### The Core Concept

**"Shoulder Approach"** = AI acts as the technician's backup shoulder, catching missed calls and converting them into bookings automatically.

**Key Principle:** The technician remains the primary contact. AI only activates when technician is unavailable (busy/missed call).

---

## 🔗 THE THREE-SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### System 1: Google Ads (Lead Source)
**Purpose:** Generate qualified leads searching for drain cleaning services

**Configuration:**
- Target Keywords: "drain cleaning near me", "clogged drain repair", "emergency plumber"
- Geographic Targeting: Local service area
- Budget: Optimized for CPL < ₹200
- Ad Copy: High-ticket positioning (professional, reliable, immediate service)

**Success Metric:** CPL (Cost Per Lead) < ₹200

---

### System 2: Conditional Call Forwarding (Trigger)
**Purpose:** Activate AI backup only when technician misses call

**How It Works:**
1. Customer calls technician's primary business number
2. If technician answers → Normal service (AI not involved)
3. If technician is busy/doesn't answer → Call forwards to GHL tracking number
4. GHL captures lead data and triggers automation

**Technical Setup:**
- Carrier-specific conditional forwarding code (e.g., *004*<GHL-number>#)
- Activates only on busy/unanswered
- Weekly AI test to ensure forwarding is active

**Success Metric:** 100% missed call capture rate

---

### System 3: GoHighLevel (Execution Engine)
**Purpose:** Automate lead nurturing and booking process

**5 Core Workflows:**

#### Workflow 1: Missed Call Recovery
- **Trigger:** Incoming call to GHL number with status "No Answer"
- **Action:** Immediate SMS text-back
- **Message:** "Sorry we missed you. Do you need a Drain Cleanout? Reply YES for a quote."
- **Follow-up:** If no reply in 5 minutes, send email

#### Workflow 2: Offer/Quote
- **Trigger:** Lead replies YES to initial text
- **Action:** Send standardized pricing
- **Message:** "Great. For basic clogs, our rate is $150. Can we book you now?"
- **Options:** BOOK or CALL

#### Workflow 3: Booking Confirmation
- **Trigger:** Lead replies BOOK or human books in GHL calendar
- **Action:** Send confirmation with technician details
- **Message:** "Confirmed! [Technician Name] will arrive [Date/Time]. Contact: [Phone]"

#### Workflow 4: Post-Job Review Request
- **Trigger:** Job status changes to "Completed" in GHL pipeline
- **Action:** Send review request 4 hours after completion
- **Message:** "Thanks for choosing us! Please share your experience: [Google/Yelp Link]"

#### Workflow 5: AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) Offer
- **Trigger:** Job status "Completed" + 30 days elapsed
- **Action:** Send AMC offer
- **Message:** "Prevent future clogs! Annual maintenance for $299/year. [Link to details]"

**Success Metric:** Lead-to-Booking Rate > 25%

## 🤖 THE AGENTIC AI LAYER

### Three AI Agents Working Together

#### Agent 1: Monitor Agent (Observation)
**Purpose:** Continuously track system performance

**What It Monitors:**
- CPL from Google Ads API
- Lead-to-Booking rate from GHL pipeline
- Conditional forwarding status (weekly test)
- Response times and conversion rates

**Alert Triggers:**
- CPL > ₹200 (above threshold)
- Booking rate < 25% (below target)
- Forwarding test fails (system down)

**Output:** Performance dashboard + alerts to Diagnostic Agent

---

#### Agent 2: Diagnostic Agent (Analysis)
**Purpose:** Identify root cause when performance drops

**Diagnostic Process:**
1. Receive alert from Monitor Agent
2. Analyze data sources:
   - Google Ads search terms (wrong targeting?)
   - GHL conversation logs (offer/pricing issue?)
   - Forwarding test results (technical failure?)
3. Run diagnosis framework:
   - **Diagnosis 1:** Wrong Ad Targeting (irrelevant search terms)
   - **Diagnosis 2:** Forwarding Down (missed calls not captured)
   - **Diagnosis 3:** Offer/Pricing Issue (leads not converting)
   - **Diagnosis 4:** Response Time Issue (too slow to respond)

**Output:** Root cause analysis + recommended fix to Optimizing Agent

---

#### Agent 3: Optimizing Agent (Action)
**Purpose:** Implement improvements based on diagnosis

**Powered By:** "Amit Thoughtbot" System Prompt
- Thinks like Amit: Strategic, data-driven, customer-first
- Makes decisions based on business impact
- Implements changes via APIs

**Actions It Can Take:**

**For Ad Targeting Issues:**
- Pause underperforming Ad Groups (Google Ads API)
- Add negative keywords (filter irrelevant searches)
- Adjust budget allocation (shift to high-performers)

**For Offer/Pricing Issues:**
- A/B test different SMS scripts in GHL
- Adjust pricing message (test $150 vs $175)
- Add urgency ("Limited slots today")

**For Technical Issues:**
- Alert technician to re-activate forwarding code
- Test alternative forwarding methods
- Escalate to human if critical

**Output:** Implemented changes + performance tracking
