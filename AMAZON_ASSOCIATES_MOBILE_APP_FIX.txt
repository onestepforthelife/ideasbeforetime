# 🚨 AMAZON ASSOCIATES MOBILE APP - DOMAIN ISSUE FIX

**Created:** December 5, 2025
**Issue:** Spent $12 USD on domain, mobile app still says "Entered domain is not allowed for mobile app"

## 🔍 WHAT DOMAIN DID YOU BUY?

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** What exact domain did you purchase?

**If you bought:**
- ❌ `.pages.dev` subdomain → Won't work (but you can't buy this)
- ❌ Domain from non-standard registrar → May have issues
- ✅ `.com` / `.in` / `.org` from standard registrar → Should work

**Please tell me:** What domain did you buy? (e.g., ideasbeforetime.com)
