# 💰 10 MORE CREDIT SAVING STRATEGIES

**Created:** December 6, 2025, 2:15 PM IST
**Beyond Batching:** Additional ways to save 50-80% more credits

---

## 1. ✅ ASK BEFORE PUSHING (NEW!)

**Your suggestion:** "if in doubt for push u can ask if urgent or not"

**How it works:**
- Before pushing changes, I ask: "Is this urgent or can it wait for batch?"
- URGENT → Push now (5 credits)
- NOT URGENT → Add to queue (0 credits now, batched later)

**Savings:** 60-80% on pushes

**Example:**
```
Me: "Fixed typo in about.html. Urgent push or add to queue?"
You: "Queue it"
Me: [Adds to queue, saves 5 credits]
```

---

## 2. 📝 TRUST LOADED CONTEXT (ALREADY DOING)

**What it means:**
- Steering files are already loaded in my context
- Don't re-read them unless specifically needed
- Reference what I already know

**Savings:** 50 credits/day

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Read KIRO_RULES.md again (5 credits)
✅ NEW: Reference from loaded context (0 credits)
```

---

## 3. 🔍 SIMPLE VERIFICATION OVER SCRIPTS

**What it means:**
- Don't create verification scripts for simple checks
- Just read the file directly
- Trust simple verification

**Savings:** 10-15 credits per verification

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Create verify.js → Run → Read report (15 credits)
✅ NEW: Read file directly (5 credits)
```

---

## 4. 📦 PARALLEL FILE READS

**What it means:**
- Read multiple files in ONE request
- Not sequential reads

**Savings:** 66% on multi-file reads

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Read file1, Read file2, Read file3 (15 credits)
✅ NEW: Read [file1, file2, file3] parallel (5 credits)
```

---

## 5. 🎯 MINIMAL RESPONSES

**What it means:**
- Show result, not process
- Brief summaries only
- No long explanations unless asked

**Savings:** 20-30 credits/day

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: "I'm going to check X, then Y, then Z... [long explanation]"
✅ NEW: "Checked X, Y, Z. Result: ✅"
```

---

## 6. 🚀 CREATE + EXECUTE IN ONE REQUEST

**What it means:**
- Don't create script, then wait, then run
- Create + Run in same request

**Savings:** 50% per script execution

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Create script (5 credits) → Run script (5 credits) = 10 credits
✅ NEW: Create + Run (5 credits)
```

---

## 7. 📊 WEEKLY REPORTS INSTEAD OF DAILY

**What it means:**
- Don't generate status reports daily
- Generate comprehensive report weekly
- Daily: Just update queue file

**Savings:** 100+ credits/week

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Daily status report (10 credits × 7 days = 70 credits)
✅ NEW: Weekly comprehensive report (20 credits)
Savings: 50 credits/week
```

---

## 8. 🔄 REUSE EXISTING SCRIPTS

**What it means:**
- Don't create new scripts for similar tasks
- Modify existing scripts
- Build library of reusable tools

**Savings:** 30-40 credits/week

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Create new check-X.js (10 credits)
✅ NEW: Modify existing check-all.js (2 credits)
```

---

## 9. 💬 CLARIFY BEFORE EXECUTING

**What it means:**
- If unclear, ask ONE clarifying question
- Don't execute multiple approaches
- Get it right first time

**Savings:** 50-100 credits per unclear request

**Example:**
```
❌ OLD: Try approach A (10 credits) → Wrong → Try B (10 credits) → Wrong → Try C (10 credits) = 30 credits
✅ NEW: "Do you mean A, B, or C?" → Execute correct one (10 credits)
Savings: 20 credits
```

## 10. 📅 SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE WINDOWS

**What it means:**

- Not scattered throughout week

**Savings:** 200+ credits/month

**Tasks to batch:**

- Link checking
- Performance testing

**Example:**
