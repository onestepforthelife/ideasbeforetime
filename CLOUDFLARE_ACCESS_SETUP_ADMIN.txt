🔒 CLOUDFLARE ACCESS SETUP - Admin Pages
Created: December 9, 2025

⚠️ CRITICAL: Admin pages are NOT protected yet!
Anyone can access admin panel without login.

📋 PAGES THAT NEED PROTECTION:
1. admin-control-panel.html (Main admin panel)
2. admin-testing-dashboard.html (GODA testing dashboard)
3. social-optimizer-admin.html (SPO admin - already has comment)

🔧 SETUP STEPS (5 minutes):

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
   https://dash.cloudflare.com

2. Select your site: onestepforthelife.com

3. Go to: Zero Trust → Access → Applications

4. Click: "Add an application"

5. Choose: "Self-hosted"

6. Configure Application:
   - Name: "Admin Panel"
   - Session Duration: 24 hours
   - Application domain: onestepforthelife.com
   - Path: /admin-*
   
7. Add Policy:
   - Policy name: "Admin Only"
   - Action: Allow
   - Include: Emails
   - Value: onestepforthelife@gmail.com (your email)

8. Save Application

9. Test:
   - Visit: https://onestepforthelife.com/admin-control-panel.html
   - Should redirect to Cloudflare login
   - Enter your email
   - Get OTP code
   - Login successful → Access granted

✅ RESULT:
- Admin pages protected by Cloudflare Access
- Only your email can access
- Server-side protection (cannot be bypassed)
- No JavaScript passwords needed

🎯 PATHS TO PROTECT:
/admin-* (covers all admin pages)
/social-optimizer-admin.html (SPO admin)

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Admin panel has sensitive operations
- Testing dashboard shows all site data
- SPO admin shows user payments
- MUST be protected before going live
