## GITHUB DESKTOP STEPS:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You should see 10-15 changed files
3. Review changes (make sure they look correct)
4. Commit message: "Fix GODA chatbot + update domain to onestepforthelife.com"
5. Push to origin

---

## AFTER PUSH (MANDATORY - 10 minutes):

### Step 1: Check Build Logs (30 seconds)
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click: Workers & Pages → onestepforthelife
3. Click: Deployments tab
4. Click: Latest deployment → View details
5. Read: Build log for any errors
6. Look for: "Success" or errors

### Step 2: Purge Cache (MANDATORY!)
1. Still in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Click: Caching → Configuration
3. Click: "Purge Everything" button
4. Confirm: Yes
5. Wait: 5-10 minutes (MUST WAIT!)

### Step 3: Test Live Site (5 minutes)
1. Wait full 5-10 minutes (cache propagation)
2. Run: node COMPREHENSIVE_LIVE_SITE_CHECK_DEC6.js
3. Should show: 0 critical issues
4. All pages should return: 200 OK (not 308)

---

## WHAT SHOULD WORK AFTER PUSH:

✅ GODA chatbot responds to messages
✅ Numbered options (1-4) work
✅ New Topic button clears conversation
✅ All domain references point to onestepforthelife.com
✅ No 308 redirects (after cache purge + wait)

---

## IF ISSUES AFTER PUSH:

### GODA still doesn't respond:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red errors
3. Tell me exact error message
4. I'll fix based on actual error

### 308 redirects still showing:
1. Did you purge cache? (Step 2)
2. Did you wait 5-10 minutes? (MUST WAIT!)
3. Cache takes time to propagate worldwide
4. Test again after full wait time

### Build failed:
1. Check build logs (Step 1)
2. Look for error message
3. Tell me what it says
4. Usually: file size or syntax error

---

## VERIFICATION PASSED ✅

Safe to push. All checks passed.

Remember: Purge cache + Wait 5-10 min = Critical!
