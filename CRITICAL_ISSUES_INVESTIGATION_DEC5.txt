## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

### Action 1: Read Actual Files
Check what's actually in these files:
- spo.html
- jobs.html  
- admin-control-panel.html
- social-optimizer-app.js
- job-api-client.js

### Action 2: Check File Paths
Verify all script includes:
- <script src="..."> paths correct?
- CSS files loading?
- Images loading?

### Action 3: Check Live URLs
Test these URLs work:
- https://onestepforthelife.com/spo.html
- https://onestepforthelife.com/jobs.html
- https://onestepforthelife.com/admin-control-panel.html

### Action 4: Check Console Errors

### Cause 4: Missing Dependencies
**Symptom:** "X is not defined" errors
**Solution:** Include all required JavaScript libraries

### Cause 5: Wrong Paths

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY:

**SPO Tool = MONEY** - Users paid ₹21, tool must work!
**Job Search = VALUE** - Core feature for users
**Admin Panel = CONTROL** - Need access to manage site

**All 3 must work. No excuses. Find root cause. Fix it.**
