## 🚨 ISSUES FIXED

### Issue 1: Email Popup Appearing
**Problem:** System was opening mailto: link which triggered email client popup
**Solution:** Removed mailto: link completely, now stores request locally

### Issue 2: No Pre-Approval System
**Problem:** All users had to wait for manual approval
**Solution:** Added pre-approved email list for instant access

### Issue 3: Confusing User Experience
**Problem:** Users didn't know if email was sent or what to do next
**Solution:** Clear messages based on approval status

```javascript
const preApprovedEmails = [
