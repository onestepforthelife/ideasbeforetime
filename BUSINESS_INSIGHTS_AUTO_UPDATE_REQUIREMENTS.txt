# BUSINESS INSIGHTS AUTO-UPDATE REQUIREMENTS
**Created:** December 8, 2025
**Purpose:** Define requirements for auto-updating business-insights.html every 4 hours

---

## WHAT MUST WORK:

1. **Auto-Update Every 4 Hours**
   - Page content updates automatically
   - No manual intervention needed
   - Runs 24/7 continuously

2. **Latest Data with Sources**
   - AI & Technology trends (with source links)
   - M&A news (with source links)
   - Startup funding (with source links)
   - Business closures (with source links)
   - Forex rates (live data with source)
   - Commodity prices (live data with source)
   - Global trends (with source links)

3. **Source References**
   - Each insight must have source link
   - Format: "Source: [Publication Name](URL)"
   - Credible sources only (Reuters, Bloomberg, ET, Mint, TechCrunch, etc.)

4. **Data Freshness**
   - "Last Updated" timestamp shows actual update time
   - Content is from last 24-48 hours (not November 2024!)
   - Old/outdated insights removed automatically

5. **Reliability**
   - Works even if one data source fails
   - Graceful degradation (show what's available)
   - Error logging for debugging

---

## WHAT MUST NOT HAPPEN:

1. **No Stale Data**
   - Must not show "November 2024" when it's December 2025
   - Must not show outdated prices/rates

2. **No Broken Sources**
   - Must not show "Source: undefined"
   - Must not have dead links

3. **No Manual Updates**
   - User should NOT have to update content manually
   - Should be fully automated

---

## IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:

### Option A: Cloudflare Workers + Cron Trigger (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros:**
- Native Cloudflare integration
- Cron triggers built-in (every 4 hours)
- Can fetch from multiple APIs
- Can update HTML dynamically
- Free tier: 100,000 requests/day

**Cons:**
- Requires Cloudflare Workers setup
- Need API keys for data sources
- More complex initial setup

**How it works:**
1. Create Cloudflare Worker script
2. Set cron trigger: `0 */4 * * *` (every 4 hours)
3. Worker fetches data from APIs (news, forex, commodities)
4. Worker generates updated HTML
5. Worker updates business-insights.html via GitHub API or KV storage
6. Page shows fresh data

### Option B: GitHub Actions + Scheduled Workflow
**Pros:**
- Already using GitHub
- Scheduled workflows built-in
- Can commit updated HTML to repo
- Free for public repos

**Cons:**
- Requires GitHub Actions setup
- Need API keys for data sources
- Cloudflare cache must be purged after update

**How it works:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/update-business-insights.yml`
2. Schedule: `0 */4 * * *` (every 4 hours)
3. Action fetches data from APIs
4. Action generates updated HTML
5. Action commits to GitHub
6. Cloudflare auto-deploys
7. Action purges Cloudflare cache

### Option C: Client-Side JavaScript (SIMPLEST)
**Pros:**
- No server setup needed
- Works immediately
- Easy to implement

**Cons:**
- API keys exposed in browser (security risk)
- Rate limits per user
- Slower (fetches on every page load)
- No caching

**How it works:**
1. Add JavaScript to business-insights.html
2. On page load, fetch data from APIs
3. Update DOM with fresh data
4. Cache in localStorage (4 hour expiry)

## NEXT STEPS:

**If user says "do it now":**
1. Implement Option C (client-side) first (1 hour)
2. Test on live site
3. Then upgrade to Option B (GitHub Actions) for full automation

**If user provides API keys:**
1. Implement Option B (GitHub Actions) directly (4 hours)
2. Full automation from day 1

**If user wants best solution:**
1. Implement Option A (Cloudflare Workers) (8 hours)
2. Production-grade, scalable solution

**Status:** REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTED - Awaiting user decision
