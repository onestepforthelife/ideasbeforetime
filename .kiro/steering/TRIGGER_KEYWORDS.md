# 🎯 TRIGGER KEYWORDS - Auto-Run Tests & Checks

**Created:** December 2, 2025  
**Updated:** December 3, 2025 (Added "record it" keyword)
**Purpose:** Keywords that make Kiro automatically run all tests

---

## 🆕 MASTER KEYWORD (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### **"record it"** | **"update rules"** | **"record & update"**

**When Amit says this, I AUTOMATICALLY update ALL relevant files:**
1. ✅ 3_WEEKS_COMPLETE_LEARNINGS.md (add new learning)
2. ✅ GOLDEN_RULES.md (if fundamental rule)
3. ✅ COMPLETE_TESTING_RULESET.md (if new test needed)
4. ✅ TRIGGER_KEYWORDS.md (if new keyword)
5. ✅ BRUTAL_HONESTY.md (if performance issue)
6. ✅ MASTER_RULES_ORGANIZED.md (if workflow change)

**Then report:** "Recorded in [list of files]"

**This means:** LIVE LEARNING - No repeated mistakes!

---

## 🚨 TRIGGER KEYWORDS - When Amit Says These:

### 1. **"check"** or **"verify"** or **"test"** or **"make sure"** or **"ensure"**
**Action:** Run ALL automated tests + check what Amit specifically mentioned:
```bash
node test-for-common-mistakes.js
node test-site-consistency.js
node test-industry-standards.js
node test-content-consistency.js
node test-double-headers.js
```
**PLUS:** Check the specific thing Amit mentioned (colors, headers, links, etc.)

### 2. **"still"** (as in "still broken")
**Action:** 
- Admit I was wrong
- Run tests to find the actual issue
- Fix it properly
- Verify with tests
- THEN say "fixed"

### 3. **"why"** (as in "why still 2 headers")
**Action:**
- Don't make excuses
- Run tests immediately
- Show actual test results
- Fix the real problem

### 4. **"done or pending"**
**Action:**
- Run ALL tests
- Show actual status (not assumptions)
- List what's truly done vs pending
- Be honest about what's not working

### 5. **"mistakes"** or **"errors"** or **"issues"**
**Action:**
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Show all found issues
- Create fix scripts
- Verify fixes with tests

### 6. **"all"** (as in "check all pages")
**Action:**
- Don't check just one file
- Check EVERY file in workspace
- Use automated scripts
- Show counts (X/Y done)

### 7. **"really"** or **"actually"** (as in "is it really fixed?")
**Action:**
- This means Amit doubts me
- I probably said "fixed" without testing
- Run tests NOW
- Show proof

### 8. **"upload"** or **"deploy"** or **"push"**
**Action:**
- Run ALL tests first
- Show test results
- Only proceed if tests pass
- Create deployment checklist

## 🎯 AMIT'S COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Short Questions
- "done or pending?"
- "check"
- "why still X?"

**Meaning:** Amit wants facts, not explanations. Run tests, show results.

### Pattern 2: Pointing Out Issues
- "still 2 headers here"
- "where are my posts?"
- "articles & posts are different"

**Meaning:** I missed something. Don't defend, just fix it properly.

### Pattern 3: Asking About Process
- "what you want do more?"
- "would you like to record learnings?"

**Meaning:** Amit wants me to improve my process. Update steering files.

## 📚 LESSONS FROM TODAY (Dec 2, 2025)

### Mistake 1: Said "Fixed" Without Testing
**Trigger:** Amit said "why still 2 headers"
**Lesson:** Never say "fixed" without running tests
**Solution:** Created automated test suite

### Mistake 2: Confused Articles vs Posts
**Trigger:** Amit said "articles & posts are different"
**Lesson:** Verify terminology before assuming
**Solution:** Ask for clarification on platform-specific terms

### Mistake 3: Didn't Check All Files
**Trigger:** Found 5 files with duplicate navigation
**Lesson:** "Fix navigation" means ALL files, not just one
**Solution:** Always use scripts to check all files

### Mistake 4: Assumed vs Verified
**Trigger:** Amit asked "done or pending?"
**Lesson:** Don't assume based on memory, check actual files
**Solution:** Run tests to show actual status

## 🎯 NEW GOLDEN RULE #13: TRIGGER KEYWORDS = AUTO-TEST

**When Amit uses trigger keywords, AUTOMATICALLY:**
1. Run all test scripts
2. Show results
3. Fix issues found
4. Re-test
5. Show proof

**NEVER:**
- Say "looks good" without testing
- Assume it's fixed
- Trust memory over tests
- Make excuses

**ALWAYS:**
- Test first, talk second
- Show proof, not promises
- Be honest about failures
- Fix properly, not quickly

---

## 📊 TEST CHECKLIST

Before saying "done" or "fixed", verify:

```
☐ Ran test-for-common-mistakes.js
☐ Ran test-site-consistency.js
☐ All tests passed (0 errors)
☐ Checked actual files (not just memory)
☐ Verified on multiple files (not just one)
☐ Created fix scripts (not manual fixes)
☐ Re-tested after fixes
☐ Can show proof (test output)
```

## 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE

| Amit Says | I Do |
|-----------|------|
| "check" | Run all tests |
| "still broken" | Admit mistake, test, fix properly |
| "why" | Show test results, no excuses |
| "all" | Check EVERY file, show counts |
| "done or pending" | Run tests, show actual status |
| "really fixed?" | Show test proof |

---

## 💡 REMEMBER

**Amit's patience is limited. When he asks "why still broken?":**
- He's already frustrated
- I already said "fixed" before
- He's checking my work
- I need to fix it RIGHT NOW
- No more excuses

**The answer is:**
1. "You're right, I didn't verify properly"
2. [Run tests]
3. [Show results]
4. [Fix properly]
5. [Show proof]

## 🎯 GOLDEN RULE #13: WHEN AMIT SAYS "CHECK" - CHECK EVERYTHING

**When Amit says "check X":**
1. ✅ Check X (what he specifically mentioned)
2. ✅ Check ALL related things
3. ✅ Run ALL automated tests
4. ✅ Check what I'm NOT checking
5. ✅ Show complete results

**Example:**
- Amit: "check colors"
- I check: Colors in HTML + CSS + JS + all 47 files
- I run: All 5 test scripts
- I report: "Checked colors in 47 HTML, 5 CSS, 8 JS files. Found 0 purple. ✅"

**NEVER just check the one thing mentioned - check EVERYTHING related!**
