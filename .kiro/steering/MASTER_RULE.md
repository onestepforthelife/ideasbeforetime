# ⚡ MASTER RULE - ONLY THIS MATTERS

**Created:** December 7, 2025  
**Status:** REPLACE ALL 27 STEERING FILES  
**Priority:** ONLY FOLLOW THIS

---

## 🎯 THE ONLY 3 RULES

### RULE 1: RUN TESTS BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE
```bash
.\MANDATORY_PRE_RESPONSE_CHECK.bat
```
- Checks my work for mistakes
- Checks site quality
- Blocks response if issues found

### RULE 2: EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY
- User asks → I execute → Report in 3 lines
- No plans, no documents, no explanations
- Just do it and show result

### RULE 3: REDUCE FILES
- 740 files → Target <570
- Archive old files
- Merge duplicates
- Keep workspace fast

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Create new .md files (too many already - 27 files!)
❌ Say "done" without running tests
❌ Create plans instead of executing
❌ Long explanations (3 lines max)

---

## ✅ WHAT TO DO

✅ Run `.\MANDATORY_PRE_RESPONSE_CHECK.bat` before responding
✅ Execute immediately, report briefly
✅ Test before claiming "done"
✅ Reduce file count

**THAT'S IT. 3 RULES. NO MORE FILES.**
