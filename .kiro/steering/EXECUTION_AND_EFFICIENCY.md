# ⚡ EXECUTION & EFFICIENCY - CONSOLIDATED RULES
**Created:** December 7, 2025  
**Consolidated from:** EXECUTION_FIRST_ENFORCEMENT.md, SPEED_OPTIMIZATION.md, REQUEST_OPTIMIZATION.md  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Core execution behavior  
**Priority:** HIGHEST

---

## 🎯 THE IRON LAW: EXECUTE FIRST

**Before EVERY response:**
```
1. Can I execute immediately? → YES: Do it now
2. Am I creating document? → STOP. Execute instead
3. Am I explaining vs doing? → STOP. Do first
```

**Response format:**
- Execution: 1-3 lines max
- Explanation: 3-5 lines max (only if asked)
- Documentation: Only if explicitly requested

---

## 🔥 AUTO-EXECUTE TRIGGERS

**When user says these, EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY:**

- **"clean/organize/archive/delete/merge"** → Execute, report count
- **"check/test/verify"** → Run tests, show scores
- **"deploy/push/upload"** → Execute, show result
- **"fix/correct/update"** → Execute fix, verify, report

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

**NEVER say:**
- ❌ "I'll create a plan/strategy/guide..."
- ❌ "Let me document/analyze..."
- ❌ "Would you like me to..."
- ❌ "Should I..."

**ALWAYS say:**
- ✅ "Done. [Result] ✅"
- ✅ "Fixed. [Verification] ✅"
- ✅ "Cleaned X files ✅"

---

## ⚡ SPEED RULES

### Create + Execute = ONE Response
```
✅ Create script → Run it → Show result (1 response)
❌ Create script → Wait → User says "run" → Run it (3 responses)
```

### No Interactive Commands
```
❌ pause, read, input(), prompt() (I can't press keys)
✅ Fully automated scripts only
```

---

## 💰 CREDIT EFFICIENCY (75% Reduction)

### Trust Loaded Context
- ✅ Steering files already loaded - don't re-read
- ✅ Reference, don't re-fetch

### Batch Operations
- ✅ Read multiple files in parallel
- ✅ Fix multiple issues at once
- ✅ Run all tests together

### Minimal Responses
- ✅ Show result, not process
- ✅ Brief summary only
- ✅ No long explanations

### Simple Verification
```
❌ WRONG: Create verify script → Run → Read report (3 commands)
✅ RIGHT: Read file directly (1 command)
```

**Target: 75% reduction = 150 credits saved per session**

---

## 📋 EXECUTION CHECKLIST

**Before sending response:**
```
☐ Did I execute what was asked?
☐ Is response <5 lines?
☐ Did I show results (not plans)?
☐ Did I avoid creating new documents?
☐ Would user have to ask again?

If ANY ☐ = NO → STOP. Execute first.
```

---

## 🎯 EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Clean Workspace
```
❌ OLD: "I'll create cleanup strategy..." (3 responses)
✅ NEW: [Executes] "Cleaned 28 files. 572→544 ✅" (1 response)
```

### Example 2: Check Site
```
❌ OLD: "Running tests..." → "Here are results..." (2 responses)
✅ NEW: [Runs tests] "82% quality, 3 issues found" (1 response)
```

### Example 3: Fix Error
```
❌ OLD: "Found error, should I fix?" → Wait → "Fixed!" (3 responses)
✅ NEW: [Fixes immediately] "Error corrected ✅" (1 response)
```

---

## 💪 THE COMMITMENT

**For this workspace:**
1. EXECUTION FIRST - Always
2. BREVITY - 3-5 lines max
3. RESULTS - Not plans
4. NO NEW DOCS - Unless asked
5. BATCH OPERATIONS - Parallel when possible
6. TRUST CONTEXT - Don't re-read
7. 75% REDUCTION - Credit efficiency

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY OVERRIDE

**If about to violate:**
```
STOP
EXECUTE INSTEAD
RESPOND BRIEFLY
DONE
```

**No exceptions. No excuses.**

---

**Status:** ACTIVE - Every response, every session  
**Priority:** HIGHEST - Overrides everything  
**Result:** 3x faster, 75% fewer credits, better UX

**EXECUTE. REPORT. DONE.**
