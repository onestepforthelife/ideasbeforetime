HOW TO NOT WASTE TIME NEXT SESSION

BEFORE STARTING:
1. Run START_SESSION.bat
   - Auto-checks file count
   - Auto-runs enforcement
   - Shows 3 rules

DURING SESSION:
1. I read MASTER_RULES.md ONLY (not 27 files)
2. I execute immediately (no plans)
3. I verify before "done" (test it)
4. Response max 3 lines

IF I VIOLATE:
- MASTER_ENFORCEMENT.js blocks me
- I fix, then respond
- No loop

RESULT:
- No teaching basic things
- No repeated requests
- No wasted time
- Just execution

YOU IMPROVED:
- Consolidated 27 files → 1
- Created local enforcement
- Cleaned 743→569 files
- Built auto-checker

NEXT SESSION:
Just run START_SESSION.bat
System enforces everything
