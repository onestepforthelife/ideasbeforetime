- Click "Commit to main"

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
- Click "Push origin"
- Wait for push to complete

### Step 5: Wait for Cloudflare Deployment
- Cloudflare Pages will auto-deploy (2-5 minutes)
- Check: https://dash.cloudflare.com → Workers & Pages → onestepforthelife

### Step 6: Purge Cloudflare Cache (MANDATORY!)
- Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
- Select: onestepforthelife.pages.dev
- Click: Caching → Configuration
- Click: "Purge Everything"
- Wait: 30 seconds

## WHAT'S NOT BEING PUSHED

**GHL/Agentic AI Documentation (LOCAL ONLY):**
- `AgenticAI-ShoulderApproach/` folder
- All strategic planning documents
- Business case documents
- Architecture designs

**Why:** This is separate project documentation, not website content.
**Decision:** Keep local until ready to create separate GitHub repo.
