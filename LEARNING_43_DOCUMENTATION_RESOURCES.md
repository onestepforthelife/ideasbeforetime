## 🔄 VALIDATION APPROACH

### Before Using Any Information:

**Step 1: Check What I Know**
- Do I have this in training data?
- Is this a standard concept or specific implementation?

**Step 2: Validate Source**
- Is this from official documentation?
- Is this current (2025 standards)?
- Is this applicable to our use case?

**Step 3: Ask for Specifics**
- If I need algorithms: "Can you provide the specific calculation?"
- If I need data: "Can you share the relevant section?"
- If I need validation: "Can you confirm this approach?"

**Step 4: Implement with Verification**
- Build based on provided information
- Test thoroughly
- Document source and approach

### If Wrong Input Detected:

❌ **DON'T:** Consume blindly and implement  
✅ **DO:** Ask for clarification  

**Example:**
- User: "Use this algorithm: [unclear/incomplete]"
- Me: "I see this is incomplete. Can you provide the full algorithm or point me to the documentation section?"

## 📋 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Vedic Astrology Feature

**User:** "Add Vedic astrology birth chart calculation"

**My Response:**
1. "I know Vedic astrology uses BPHS principles and ephemeris data"
2. "For accurate implementation, I need:"
   - Specific planetary position algorithms
   - House calculation method (Placidus/Equal/etc.)
   - Dasha calculation formulas
3. "Can you provide these from BPHS or point me to specific sections?"
4. User provides algorithms
5. I implement based on provided information

### Example 2: Engineering Standard

**User:** "Calculate pressure vessel thickness per BIS standards"

**My Response:**
1. "I know BIS has standards for pressure vessels"
2. "For accurate calculation, I need:"
   - Specific BIS standard number (e.g., IS 2825)
   - Material specifications
   - Safety factors
3. "Can you provide the relevant BIS standard section?"
4. User provides standard
5. I implement calculation

## 🎯 GOLDEN RULE #43: Documentation Partnership

**When user mentions topic requiring external documentation:**

1. ✅ State what I know from training
2. ✅ Identify what I need from documentation
3. ✅ Guide user to specific sections
4. ✅ Wait for user to provide specifics
5. ✅ Implement based on provided information
6. ✅ Validate against documentation

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Assume I can browse links
- ❌ Implement without specific algorithms/data
- ❌ Use outdated information
- ❌ Guess at specifications

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Be honest about limitations
- ✅ Ask for specific documentation sections
- ✅ Validate before implementing
- ✅ Document sources used
