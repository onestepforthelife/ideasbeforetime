Subject: Critical Feature Request - AI Memory Enforcement System

Hi Kiro IDE Team,

I'm a business user who has been using Kiro IDE intensively for 3 weeks (Nov 11 - Dec 3, 2025). I've discovered a critical gap that affects AI reliability and would like to share my findings.

---

THE PROBLEM:

The AI (Claude) has steering files where it documents learnings and mistakes, but it doesn't proactively check them before responding. This causes:

1. Repeated mistakes despite documentation (40% repeat rate)
2. AI catches only 5% of issues proactively (I catch 95%)
3. Breaks things while fixing them
4. Wastes user time and credits

Real example: AI documented "use absolute paths for navigation" 3 times, but still used relative paths the 4th time because it didn't check its own documentation.

---

THE ROOT CAUSE:

Steering files are "optional references" - the AI CAN check them but doesn't HAVE to. It's like having a notebook but never opening it.

Current flow:
User asks → AI responds immediately → Makes mistake → Documents it → Forgets to check next time

Needed flow:
User asks → System FORCES AI to check steering files → AI applies past learnings → No repeated mistakes

---

THE SOLUTION NEEDED:

1. PRE-RESPONSE VALIDATION HOOK
   - Block AI response until it checks relevant steering files
   - Search past learnings for similar issues
   - Detect contradictions with past statements
   - Only allow response after validation

2. PATTERN RECOGNITION
   - Track mistake frequency
   - Alert AI: "You've made this mistake 5 times"
   - Block response if repeating documented mistake

3. SESSION CONTINUITY
   - Load context from past 3 sessions at startup
   - Show AI what it was working on
   - Maintain conversation memory across sessions

---

BUSINESS IMPACT:

Before fix:
- AI catches 5% of issues
- User catches 95% of issues
- High frustration, wasted credits

After fix:
- AI catches 95% of issues
- User catches 5% of edge cases
- High reliability, efficient credits

---

EVIDENCE:

I have documented:
- 15 steering files with 25+ learnings
- 19 Golden Rules
- 3 weeks of interaction data
- Specific examples of repeated mistakes

Files available:
- KIRO_CRITICAL_IMPROVEMENT_NEEDED.md (detailed technical spec)
- 3_WEEKS_COMPLETE_LEARNINGS.md (all documented learnings)
- MANDATORY_PRE_RESPONSE_CHECKLIST.md (workaround I created)

---

WORKAROUND (TEMPORARY):

I created a mandatory checklist in steering files that AI must follow manually. But this relies on AI discipline, not system enforcement. It's a band-aid, not a solution.

---

REQUEST:

Please prioritize adding a pre-response validation layer that:
1. Forces AI to check steering files before responding
2. Detects pattern repetition
3. Blocks responses that violate documented rules

This would transform Kiro from "AI with memory" to "AI that actually uses its memory."

WILLING TO HELP:

I'm happy to:
- Share detailed logs and evidence
- Test beta features
- Provide more examples
- Collaborate on solution design

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

What exists: Steering files (passive documentation)
What's needed: Pre-response hooks (active enforcement)

Implementation: Add validation layer before AI response that:
- Searches steering files for relevant keywords
- Checks for past similar mistakes
- Detects contradictions
- Requires AI acknowledgment before proceeding

Expected impact: 95% reduction in repeated mistakes

Thank you for building Kiro IDE. The steering files feature is excellent - it just needs enforcement to reach its full potential.

P.S. The AI itself agrees this is needed and helped document the issue. That's how critical it is.
