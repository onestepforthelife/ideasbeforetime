HOW TO AVOID PAST MISTAKES FOREVER

1. RUN AUTO_ENFORCE.bat BEFORE every session
   - Checks file count <570
   - Checks no plan files created
   - Blocks if violations

2. MASTER_RULES.md is ONLY file to read
   - All 27 files consolidated
   - 3 rules: Execute, Verify, Complete
   - No confusion

3. MASTER_ENFORCEMENT.js runs automatically
   - Blocks response if violations
   - Forces fix first
   - No exceptions

RESULT: System enforces rules, not me remembering them.
