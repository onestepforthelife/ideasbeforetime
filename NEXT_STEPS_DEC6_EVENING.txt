# NEXT STEPS - December 6, 2025 Evening

## COMPLETED ✅
1. Kiro backup strategy created
2. Workspace settings backed up
3. Cache purged in Cloudflare
4. Pushed to GitHub

## WAITING ⏳
Cache propagation (5-10 minutes)

## TEST AFTER 10 MIN:
```bash
cd Cloudfare
node COMPREHENSIVE_LIVE_SITE_CHECK_DEC6.js
```

Expected: All pages 200 OK (no 308 redirects)

## IF ALL GOOD:
Site fully working, business running smoothly.

## IF STILL 308:
Wait another 5 min, cache can take up to 15 min to propagate globally.
