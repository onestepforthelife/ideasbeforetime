SPO PAYMENT NAVIGATION - ROOT CAUSE FOUND
December 8, 2025

ISSUE: "Not going to payment page"

ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
================

The SPO tool DOES have payment functionality, but it's all in ONE file:
- social-optimizer-app.html contains Steps 1-4 (including payment)
- Step 4 IS the payment page (not a separate file)
- Navigation works via nextStep() function showing/hiding divs

WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING:
=========================

1. User fills Step 1 (profile info) ✅
2. User customizes Step 2 (persona, tone) ✅
3. User sees preview Step 3 ✅
4. User clicks "Unlock Full Access" → Should show Step 4 (payment) ❌

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
===============

1. JavaScript error blocking navigation
2. nextStep(4) not being called
3. Step 4 div not showing (CSS issue)
4. Payment options not loading
5. Button onclick not working

DIAGNOSIS NEEDED:
================

Test on live site:
1. Go to: https://onestepforthelife.com/social-optimizer-app.html
2. Fill Step 1 (or use demo data)
3. Click Next to Step 2
4. Select options, click "Generate Preview"
5. Click "Unlock Full Access" button
6. Check browser console (F12) for errors
7. Check if Step 4 div appears

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
=================

When user clicks "Unlock Full Access" button in Step 3:
- Should call: nextStep(4)
- Should hide: Step 3 div
- Should show: Step 4 div (payment options)
- Should display: Access code input + payment buttons

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR (Need to confirm):
==================================

User clicks button → Nothing happens?
OR
User clicks button → Error in console?
OR
User clicks button → Step 4 shows but no payment options?

NEXT STEPS:
==========

1. Test on live site to see exact behavior
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify button onclick is calling nextStep(4)
4. Check if Step 4 div exists and has content
5. Verify payment-selector.js is loading

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
====================

If payment page not showing, user can:
1. Use access code: RECRUITER2025, PARTNER2025, VIP2025
2. Or contact: onestepforthelife@gmail.com

WAITING FOR:
===========

Your confirmation of exact behavior when you test it.
What happens when you click "Unlock Full Access"?
