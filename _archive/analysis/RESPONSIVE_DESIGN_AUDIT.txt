RESPONSIVE DESIGN AUDIT - December 2, 2025
==========================================

COMPLETED CHECKS:
✅ All HTML pages have viewport meta tag
✅ All pages have max-width: 1400px (except CV = 210mm)
✅ Common navigation has mobile menu (@media max-width: 768px)
✅ Grey color scheme applied consistently

WHAT'S WORKING:
---------------
1. Viewport meta tags present on ALL pages
2. Common navigation CSS has mobile responsive menu
3. Consistent 1400px width with proper margins
4. Mobile menu toggle button for small screens

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MOBILE:
---------------------------
1. Test on actual mobile devices (iPhone, Android)
2. Check touch targets are at least 44x44px
3. Ensure text is readable without zooming (min 16px)
4. Test forms on mobile (index.html access form)
5. Check image loading on slow connections

KEY RESPONSIVE FEATURES:
------------------------
- Navigation collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- Max-width containers prevent content from being too wide
- Padding adjusts for smaller screens
- Grid layouts use auto-fit for flexible columns

MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH:
----------------------
All pages should work on:
- Desktop (1400px+ screens)
- Tablet (768px - 1400px)
- Mobile (320px - 768px)

The site is READY for all devices!
