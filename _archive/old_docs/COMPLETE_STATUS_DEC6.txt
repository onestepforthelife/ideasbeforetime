- ❌ Still showing 308 redirects on live site
- **Reason:** Deployment not completed OR cache propagation delay

**Affected Pages:**
1. ❌ blog.html - 308 Redirect
2. ❌ about.html - 308 Redirect
3. ❌ cv.html - 308 Redirect
4. ❌ market-reports.html - 308 Redirect

8. ❌ admin-control-panel.html - 308 Redirect

### 2. Admin Panel Password and Access

- ✅ Admin panel has NO password protection (completely open)
- ✅ Direct URL provided: https://onestepforthelife.com/admin-control-panel.html
- ⚠️ Note: Admin panel currently inaccessible due to 308 redirect issue

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING:

### Issue #1: 10 Pages Showing 308 Redirects
**Impact:** HIGH - Business affected
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Users Affected:** All users trying to access:
- SPO tool (paid ₹21, cannot access!)
- Job Search
- Admin Panel
- Blog
- About
- CV
- Market Reports
- Innovations
- Library

**Root Cause:** `_redirects` file was causing redirects
**Fix Applied:** Changed rule in `_redirects` file
**Current Status:** Fix in code, pushed to GitHub, cache purged
**Why Still Broken:** 
- Deployment may not be complete
- OR cache propagation delay (10-30 minutes)
- OR working on wrong Cloudflare project

**Next Steps:**
1. Check Cloudflare deployment status
2. Verify deployment succeeded
3. Wait 10 more minutes if needed
4. Force rebuild if deployment failed
5. Purge cache again if needed
