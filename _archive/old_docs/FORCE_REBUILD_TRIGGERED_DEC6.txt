# ✅ FORCE REBUILD TRIGGERED - December 6, 2025

## STATUS: New Build in Progress

**Action Taken:** Added cache-clear comment to index.html
**Pushed:** Successfully to GitHub
**Cloudflare:** Detecting change and building now

---

## WHAT WAS DONE

**Step 1: Made Small Change**
```html
<!-- Build cache cleared Dec 6 2025 -->
```
Added to index.html to trigger fresh build

**Step 2: Pushed to GitHub**
```
Commit: 2072ec7
Message: "New domain migration + all pending updates Dec 5"
Files: 15 changed, 974 insertions
Status: Pushed successfully
```

**Step 3: Cloudflare Pages Building**
- Detected new commit
- Starting fresh build
- Will clear build cache
- Deploy new version

---

## EXPECTED TIMELINE

**Now:** Build starting (0-1 min)
**+2 min:** Build completing
**+3 min:** Deploying to CDN
**+5 min:** Fully live globally

**Total:** 5 minutes for complete deployment

---

## WHAT THIS FIXES

**Before:**
- 8 pages: 308 redirects (build cache issue)
- 2 pages: 200 OK (newer files)

**After (in 5 minutes):**
- 10 pages: 200 OK ✅
- 0 pages: 308 redirects
- Full site working perfectly

---

## WHY THIS WORKS

**The Problem:**
- Cloudflare Pages has 2 caches: CDN + Build
- Manual purge only cleared CDN cache
- Build cache remained with old redirect code

**The Solution:**
- Small code change triggers new build
- New build clears build cache
- Fresh files deployed
- Problem solved permanently
