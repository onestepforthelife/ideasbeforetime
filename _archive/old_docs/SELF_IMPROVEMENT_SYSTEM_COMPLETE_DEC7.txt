🎯 SELF-IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM COMPLETE (Dec 7, 2025)

## WHAT WAS BUILT

### 1. Local Enforcement (Kiro Hooks)
✅ .kiro/hooks/verify-before-response.json - Auto-verify before responding
✅ .kiro/hooks/daily-cleanup.json - Auto-cleanup on session start

### 2. Verification Tools
✅ verify-my-work.js - Checks AI's own work for mistakes
✅ check-site-beauty-quality.js - Visual quality checks
✅ COMPREHENSIVE_LIVE_SITE_CHECK_DEC6.js - Live site testing

### 3. Cleanup Tools
✅ cleanup-workspace.js - Safe automated cleanup
✅ aggressive-cleanup.js - Reduce file count to <570

### 4. Steering Rules (22 files)
✅ SIMPLE_3_RULES.md - Execute first, verify, complete workflow
✅ EXECUTION_FIRST_ENFORCEMENT.md - 3-line responses max
✅ VERIFY_MY_OWN_WORK_MANDATORY.md - Test before "done"
✅ THOUGHT_PROCESS_SYSTEM.md - 4-step thinking
✅ PROACTIVE_CLEANUP_MANDATORY.md - Execute, don't plan
✅ 17 more domain-specific rules

## HOW IT WORKS

**Before AI Responds:**
1. Kiro Hook triggers verify-my-work.js
2. Checks for common mistakes
3. Blocks response if issues found
4. Forces AI to fix first

**On Session Start:**
1. Kiro Hook triggers cleanup-workspace.js
2. Deletes empty files
3. Archives old files
4. Keeps workspace fast

**AI Behavior:**
1. Parse request → Execute → Report (3 lines max)
2. No plans/documents unless asked
3. Test before saying "done"
4. Complete workflow, don't stop halfway

## RESULTS EXPECTED

**Repeated Requests:**
- Before: 906 in 4 weeks (32/day)
- Target: <10/day (70% reduction)

**File Count:**
- Before: 740 files
- Target: <570 files (23% reduction)

**Response Quality:**
- Before: "All ok" without testing
- After: Shows test results, finds issues

## HOW TO USE

**User:** "clean workspace"
**AI:** [runs cleanup] "Cleaned 28 files ✅"

**User:** "check site"
**AI:** [runs tests] "85% quality, 3 issues found"

**User:** "is it ready?"
**AI:** [runs verification] "Not ready. 2 issues: [list]"

## STATUS

✅ System built
✅ Hooks created
✅ Tools working
⏳ Testing in real usage

Target: 70% fewer repeated requests, 23% fewer files, 100% verified responses.
