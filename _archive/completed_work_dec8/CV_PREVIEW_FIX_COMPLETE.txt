✅ CV PREVIEW & COLOR FIXES COMPLETE
=====================================
Date: December 5, 2025

## ISSUES FIXED:

### 1. CV Preview - Blur Overlay Blocking Buttons ✅
**Problem:** 
- OTP/email section on cv-preview.html was blurred
- Buttons were NOT clickable/usable
- User couldn't request access or enter password

**Root Cause:**
- .blurred-section had `pointer-events: none`
- This blocked ALL clicks including buttons inside blur-overlay

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to .blur-overlay
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to .unlock-box
- Now buttons are fully clickable and usable

**Result:**
✅ "Request Full Access" button works
✅ "I Have Password" button works
✅ User can interact with unlock section

---

### 2. Email Security Message - Yellow to Green ✅
**Problem:**
- Password security message had yellow background (#fff3cd)
- Yellow gives negative/warning feel
- Should match success green used elsewhere

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed background: #fff3cd → #d4edda (green)
- Changed border: #ffc107 → #28a745 (green)
- Matches .success-msg style

**Result:**
✅ Positive green color (security = good)
✅ Consistent with site success messages

---

### 3. Innovation Library - Purple to Green ✅
**Problem:**
- Hero banner had purple gradient (rgba(102, 126, 234) to rgba(118, 75, 162))
- Inconsistent with site-wide color scheme
- Should use standard green gradient

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed gradient: Purple → Standard green (#5a6c7d to #8b9aa7)
- Matches all other page headers

**Result:**
✅ Consistent color scheme across entire site
✅ Professional appearance
