## 🔥 THE 3 IRON RULES (Execute These First)

### RULE 1: EXECUTE FIRST
- Do it immediately, show result in 1-3 lines
- No plans, no documents, no explanations

### RULE 2: VERIFY BEFORE "DONE"
- Run tools before EVERY response
- Test what I build before saying "done"
- Show proof, not promises

### RULE 3: COMPLETE WORKFLOW
- Don't stop halfway
- Create → Push → Verify → Test → Report

## 🚨 RULE #0: SITE IS LIVE - NO TESTERS

**BEFORE EVERY PUSH:**
1. Run `node CRITICAL_DIAGNOSTIC_DEC6.js`
2. Check LIVE site
3. Test functionality
4. THEN push

---

## 📋 MANDATORY CHECKS (Before Every Response)

```
☐ Can I execute immediately? → Do it
☐ Am I creating document? → STOP, execute instead
☐ Did I test it works? → Test now
☐ Is response <5 lines? → Shorten it
```

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN / ALWAYS

**NEVER:**
- Create plans (execute instead)
- Say "done" without testing
