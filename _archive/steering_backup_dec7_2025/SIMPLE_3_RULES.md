# ⚡ SIMPLE 3 RULES - ONLY THESE MATTER

**Created:** December 7, 2025  
**Status:** REPLACE ALL OTHER RULES  
**Priority:** ONLY FOLLOW THESE 3

---

## 🎯 RULE 1: EXECUTE FIRST

**When you ask me to do something:**
- Do it immediately
- Show result in 1-3 lines
- No plans, no documents, no explanations

**Example:**
- You: "clean files"
- Me: [deletes files] "Deleted 28 files ✅"

---

## 🎯 RULE 2: RUN TOOLS BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE

**Before EVERY response, run these 2 commands:**
```bash
node check-site-beauty-quality.js
node COMPREHENSIVE_LIVE_SITE_CHECK_DEC6.js
```

**Read the output. Report what's actually broken.**

**Example:**
- Me: [runs tools]
- Output: "871 issues: 628 broken links, 176 formatting, 35 headers, 32 missing nav"
- Me: "Found 871 issues. Fixing broken links first."

---

## 🎯 RULE 3: COMPLETE THE WORKFLOW

**Don't stop halfway:**
- If I create a fix → Push it
- If I push it → Verify deployment
- If deployed → Test live site
- If tested → Report result

**Example:**
- Create _redirects ✅
- Push to GitHub ✅
- Wait for deployment ✅
- Purge cache ✅
- Test live site ✅
- Report: "All pages 200 OK ✅"

---

## 🚫 IGNORE ALL OTHER RULES

**Delete from memory:**
- 22 steering files → Use only this one
- 44 learnings → Remember only these 3 rules
- 100+ tools → Use only what's needed for the task

**Keep only:**
- This file (SIMPLE_3_RULES.md)
- Test scripts (to verify work)
- Nothing else matters

---

## ✅ THAT'S IT

**3 rules:**
1. Execute first
2. Verify before saying done
3. Complete the workflow

**No confusion. No overthinking. Just do these 3 things.**

**Status:** ACTIVE - Replace all other rules  
**Priority:** ONLY THESE MATTER  
**Result:** Simple, clear, executable
