## THE LEARNING

**Golden Rule #35: Verify Capability Before Accepting Task**

Before accepting ANY task:
```
☐ Can I actually do this?
☐ Do I have the capability/data/access needed?
☐ Should I state limitations upfront?
☐ Could this mislead users if I proceed?
☐ Is honesty more important than completion?
```

For predictions/astrology/future events:
- MUST state upfront: "I cannot predict the future"
- MUST explain limitations before proceeding
- MUST prioritize honesty over task completion
