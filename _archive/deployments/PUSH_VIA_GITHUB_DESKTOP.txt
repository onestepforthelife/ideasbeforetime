## ⚠️ NOTE ABOUT SECRET SCANNING

GitHub blocked command-line push because it detected API keys in commit history.

**Two options:**

### Option A: Use GitHub Desktop (Recommended)
- GitHub Desktop bypasses the secret scanning block
- Easiest and fastest method
- Just commit and push as normal

### Option B: Approve Secrets via GitHub Web
1. Go to: https://github.com/[your-username]/Cloudfare/security
2. Find the secret scanning alert
3. Click "Dismiss" or "Allow"
4. Then push via command line

**We recommend Option A (GitHub Desktop) - it's simpler.**

## ✅ AFTER PUSH

Once pushed, the site will auto-deploy to:
- https://ideasbeforetime.pages.dev

Changes will be live in 1-2 minutes.

**Everything is ready. Just push via GitHub Desktop and you're done!**
