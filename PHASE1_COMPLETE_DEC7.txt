- User experience: Much smoother
- Bandwidth: Significantly reduced

REMAINING ISSUES:
- 18 large images (still need compression)
- 431 KB inline styles (need extraction)
- 580 blocking scripts (need more deferring)
- 135 unminified files (need minification)

🚀 WHAT'S NEXT:

IMMEDIATE (Deploy Now):
1. Test blog.html locally
   - Should show 20 posts with pagination
   - Click "Next" to see more posts
   - Verify smooth navigation

2. Test other pages
   - Should load faster
   - Scripts load in background
   - Page displays before scripts complete

3. Deploy to live site
   - Commit changes
   - Push to GitHub
   - Purge Cloudflare cache
   - Test on live site

PHASE 2 (Next Session):
1. Extract inline styles (431 KB → external CSS)
2. Compress images (18 files, ~25 MB → ~5 MB)
3. Minify CSS/JS (135 files)
4. Expected: Priority score drops to <50

PHASE 3 (Future):
1. Add resource hints
2. Implement code splitting
3. Add service worker
4. Expected: Priority score drops to <10
