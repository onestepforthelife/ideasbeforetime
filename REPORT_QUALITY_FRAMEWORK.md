## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ TOO MUCH BREADTH, NO DEPTH
**Bad:** "Market exists in 50 countries"  
**Good:** "Market exists in 50 countries. Top 5 (Germany, USA, China, Japan, India) account for 75%. India is 4th largest at $50M, growing 8% CAGR."

### ❌ TOO MUCH DEPTH, NO BREADTH
**Bad:** "India imports 3,500 MT from Germany at $8.50/kg..."  
**Good:** "Global market: $500M. India: $50M (10% of global), imports 70% from Germany, USA, China..."

### ❌ GLOBAL FOCUS, INDIA IGNORED
**Bad:** "Global market dominated by BASF, Croda, Dow..."  
**Good:** "Global market dominated by BASF, Croda, Dow. In India, no major local producer, 70% import dependent, opportunity for local manufacturing."

### ❌ NUMBERS WITHOUT CONTEXT
**Bad:** "Market size: $500M"  
**Good:** "Market size: $500M (2024), growing 6% CAGR, driven by pharma demand in Asia-Pacific."

### ❌ NO STRATEGIC INSIGHT
**Bad:** "India imports 70%"  
**Good:** "India imports 70%, costing $1.35/kg more than local production. Opportunity: Local manufacturing can save 15% on landed cost, but requires EO/PO supply partnerships."
