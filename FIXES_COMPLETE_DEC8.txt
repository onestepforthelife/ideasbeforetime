✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETE - December 8, 2025
==========================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============

1. ✅ common-navigation.js - Already had extensionless URLs (no change needed)
2. ✅ test-goda.html - Updated 7 links to extensionless
3. ✅ kiro.html - Updated 3 links to extensionless  
4. ✅ sitemap.xml - Already extensionless (no change needed)

TOTAL: 10 links updated to extensionless URLs

WHY THIS FIXES 308 REDIRECTS:
==============================
- Cloudflare Pages automatically redirects .html → extensionless (308)
- Our links now use extensionless URLs directly
- No more redirects = All pages return 200 OK

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. PUSH TO GITHUB (Use GitHub Desktop):
   - Commit message: "Fix: Update all links to extensionless URLs"
   - Push to origin

2. WAIT FOR DEPLOYMENT (2-5 minutes):
   - Cloudflare will auto-deploy from GitHub

3. PURGE CLOUDFLARE CACHE (MANDATORY!):
   - Go to: Cloudflare Dashboard → Caching
   - Click: "Purge Everything"
   - Confirm

4. WAIT FOR CACHE PROPAGATION (5-10 minutes):
   - Cache propagates to all edge servers worldwide

5. TEST LIVE SITE:
   - Visit: https://onestepforthelife.com/blog
   - Should return: 200 OK (not 308)
   - All pages should work

VERIFICATION:
=============
After cache propagation, test these URLs:
- https://onestepforthelife.com/blog (200 OK)
- https://onestepforthelife.com/about (200 OK)
- https://onestepforthelife.com/cv (200 OK)
- https://onestepforthelife.com/market-reports (200 OK)
- https://onestepforthelife.com/spo (200 OK)

All should return 200 OK, no 308 redirects.

STATUS: ✅ READY TO PUSH
PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Fixes 308 redirects
RISK: LOW - Only link updates
