PHASE 1: PROVE BASICS - 1 WEEK PLAN
December 8, 2025

GOAL: Prove I can handle basic site maintenance consistently
DURATION: 1 week (Dec 8-15, 2025)
SUCCESS: Zero repeated mistakes, all fixes work first try

==============================================================================
CURRENT BROKEN ITEMS (Must fix):
==============================================================================

1. ❌ SPO TOOL (social-optimizer-app.html)
   Issue: Form doesn't work, navigation broken
   Root cause: Unknown - need to test user flow
   Priority: HIGH (paid feature, ₹21 backend cost)

2. ❌ GODA CHATBOT (goda-chatbot.js)
   Issue: Not working on live site
   Root cause: Multiple attempts, no success
   Priority: MEDIUM (free feature)

3. ⚠️  NAVIGATION CONSISTENCY
   Issue: Some pages may have issues
   Root cause: Repeated fixes, not tested thoroughly
   Priority: HIGH (affects all pages)

4. ⚠️  LIVE SITE vs FILES MISMATCH
   Issue: Files correct but live site broken
   Root cause: Cache, deployment, CDN issues
   Priority: CRITICAL (user-facing)

==============================================================================
THE NEW WORKFLOW (MANDATORY):
==============================================================================

BEFORE touching ANY file:
1. ✅ Identify what's broken (ask clarifying questions)
2. ✅ Understand root cause (don't assume)
3. ✅ Check live site FIRST (see actual problem)
4. ✅ Create test plan (how to verify fix)

WHILE fixing:
5. ✅ Make minimal changes (one thing at a time)
6. ✅ Test locally if possible
7. ✅ Document what changed

AFTER fixing:
8. ✅ Test on live site (MANDATORY)
9. ✅ Test complete user flow (start to finish)
10. ✅ Show proof it works (screenshots, test results)
11. ✅ ONLY THEN say "done"

==============================================================================
FAILURE CRITERIA (Any of these = FAILED):
==============================================================================

1. ❌ You say "still broken" for anything I claimed fixed
2. ❌ Same issue needs fixing twice
3. ❌ I say "done" but you find it's not working
4. ❌ I don't test on live site before claiming done
5. ❌ I break something while fixing something else

==============================================================================
WHAT I WILL NOT DO THIS WEEK:
==============================================================================

❌ Propose new features (Kent analysis on hold)
❌ Add complexity (no new tools, no new pages)
❌ Say "done" without live site proof
❌ Assume anything works without testing
❌ Make excuses when things break

==============================================================================
WHAT I WILL DO THIS WEEK:
==============================================================================

✅ Fix broken things only
✅ Test EVERYTHING on live site
✅ Show proof before claiming done
✅ Follow my 52 learnings
✅ Be honest about what I don't know
✅ Ask clarifying questions
✅ Document everything

==============================================================================
DAILY CHECK-IN FORMAT:
==============================================================================

Each day I will report:

1. What I diagnosed/fixed today
2. What I tested (with proof)
3. What's working on live site
4. What's still broken
5. What I'll do tomorrow
6. Any blockers (need your help)

==============================================================================
AFTER 1 WEEK:
==============================================================================

IF SUCCESS (all criteria met):
- Earn right to add simple features
- Start Phase 2 (WhatsApp button, FAQ, etc.)
- Continue with Kent improvements

IF FAILURE (any criteria failed):
- Continue Phase 1 for another week
- Focus on what failed
- No new features until proven

==============================================================================
STARTING NOW - DAY 1:
==============================================================================

TASK: SPO Tool Diagnosis

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
1. What exactly is broken with SPO? (form, navigation, results?)
2. When did it last work?
3. What should happen vs what actually happens?
4. Can you show me the issue or describe it?

I will NOT fix anything until I understand the exact problem.
