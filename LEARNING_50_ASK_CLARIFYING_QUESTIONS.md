# 🎯 LEARNING #50: Ask Clarifying Questions for Vague Issues

**Date:** December 7, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Prevents wasting time on wrong fixes

---

## WHAT HAPPENED:

User said "bad look" on about.html
I assumed it was image width issue without asking
Fixed wrong thing without verification

---

## THE CORRECT WORKFLOW:

```
User: "bad look here"

Me: "What exactly looks bad? 
     - Layout/alignment?
     - Images not showing?
     - Colors wrong?
     - Spacing issues?
     - Mobile view?
     Can you describe or screenshot?"
```

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS:

- "Bad look" could mean 20 different things
- Vague terms need clarification
- Assumptions waste time
- User knows what they see, I don't

---

## VAGUE TERMS THAT NEED CLARIFICATION:

- "bad look" → Ask what specifically
- "not working" → Ask what's expected vs actual
- "broken" → Ask what's broken exactly
- "wrong" → Ask what should it be
- "issue" → Ask what the issue is
- "problem" → Ask what the problem is
- "error" → Ask what error message/behavior

---

## GOLDEN RULE #50: Never assume vague terms - always ask clarifying questions first!

---

## PREVENTION:

Added to MASTER_RULES.md mandatory checks:
- Before fixing "bad look" → Ask what exactly
- Before fixing "not working" → Ask expected vs actual
- Before fixing "broken" → Ask what's broken
- Before fixing any vague term → Ask for specifics

---

**REMEMBER: 2 minutes asking questions > 2 hours fixing wrong thing!**
