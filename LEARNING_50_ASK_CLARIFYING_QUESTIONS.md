# LEARNING #50: Ask Clarifying Questions for Vague Terms (Dec 7, 2025)

## What Happened Today:

### Mistake 1: Assumed "bad look" without asking
- User said: "bad look" on about.html
- I assumed: Image width issue
- I should have asked: "What exactly looks bad? Layout? Images? Colors? Spacing?"
- **Result:** Fixed wrong thing without verification

### Mistake 2: Didn't understand "linkedin-portfolio" categorization
- User said: "its not a tool but blog"
- I initially: Kept it in tools navigation
- I should have asked: "Should I merge LinkedIn articles into blog page with dashboard?"
- **Result:** Had to fix multiple times

### Mistake 3: Confused "GODA (Kiro AI)" naming
- User said: "it should take to GODA kiro troubleshooter not AI"
- I had: "GODA (Kiro AI Tools)"
- I should have asked: "Is GODA a troubleshooting tool, not an AI tool?"
- **Result:** Wrong categorization and description

## The Pattern:

**VAGUE TERMS THAT NEED CLARIFICATION:**
- "bad look" → Ask: What specifically?
- "not working" → Ask: What's expected vs actual?
- "broken" → Ask: What's broken exactly?
- "wrong" → Ask: What should it be?
- "issue" → Ask: What's the issue?
- "tool" vs "blog" → Ask: How should it be categorized?
- "AI" vs "troubleshooter" → Ask: What's the actual purpose?

## The Fix:

**BEFORE assuming, ALWAYS ask:**
```
User: "bad look here"
Me: "What exactly looks bad?
     - Layout/alignment?
     - Images not showing?
     - Colors wrong?
     - Spacing issues?
     - Mobile view?
     Can you describe or screenshot?"
```

**BEFORE categorizing, ALWAYS clarify:**
```
User: "this is not a tool"
Me: "Got it. Should I:
     - Move to blog section?
     - Merge with existing blog?
     - Create separate category?
     What's the correct categorization?"
```

## Why This Matters:

1. **Saves time** - One clarifying question vs multiple fix attempts
2. **Respects user** - Shows I'm listening, not assuming
3. **Gets it right first time** - No repeated corrections
4. **Professional** - Like a real developer would ask

## Prevention:

**Add to MASTER_RULES.md:**
- Never assume vague terms
- Always ask clarifying questions first
- List 2-3 specific options for user to choose
- Wait for confirmation before implementing

## Examples of Good Clarification:

**Good:**
```
User: "fix the header"
Me: "Which aspect of the header?
     1. Alignment (left/center/right)?
     2. Height/spacing?
     3. Logo size?
     4. Navigation links?
     5. Colors?"
```

**Bad:**
```
User: "fix the header"
Me: [Assumes alignment issue, fixes wrong thing]
```

## GOLDEN RULE #50: Ask Clarifying Questions for Vague Terms

**Before implementing ANY vague request:**
1. Identify vague terms (bad, wrong, broken, not working, issue)
2. List 2-5 specific interpretations
3. Ask user which one they mean
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Then implement correctly

**This prevents:**
- ✅ Fixing wrong things
- ✅ Multiple correction attempts
- ✅ User frustration
- ✅ Wasted time

**Status:** ACTIVE - Apply to every vague request
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Prevents repeated corrections
**Result:** Get it right first time, respect user's time
