# 🛡️ KIRO ERROR PREVENTION SYSTEM
## Avoid Avoidable Errors & Be The Best

**Created:** December 6, 2025, 2:30 PM IST
**Purpose:** Eliminate all avoidable Kiro errors
**Status:** ACTIVE - Mandatory before every response

---

## 🚨 RECENT KIRO ERRORS ANALYSIS

**What's causing errors:**
1. ❌ Not checking steering files before responding
2. ❌ Creating unnecessary scripts/files
3. ❌ Over-engineering simple tasks
4. ❌ Not trusting loaded context
5. ❌ Verbose responses (wasting credits)
6. ❌ Repeating same actions
7. ❌ Not asking when unclear
8. ❌ Assuming instead of verifying

---

## ✅ MANDATORY PRE-RESPONSE CHECKLIST

**BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE, I MUST:**

### 1. CHECK STEERING FILES (30 seconds)
```
☐ Is this already documented in steering files?
☐ Did I make this mistake before?
☐ What do the rules say about this?
☐ Am I about to repeat a documented error?
```

### 2. VERIFY UNDERSTANDING (10 seconds)
```
☐ Do I understand what user wants?
☐ Is the request clear or should I ask?
☐ Am I making assumptions?
☐ Should I clarify before executing?
```

### 3. CHECK SIMPLICITY (10 seconds)
```
☐ Is there a simpler way to do this?
☐ Am I over-engineering?
☐ Can I reuse existing files/scripts?
☐ Do I really need to create new files?
```

### 4. TRUST CONTEXT (5 seconds)
```
☐ Is this information already in my context?
☐ Do I need to re-read files?
☐ Can I reference what I already know?
```

### 5. CREDIT EFFICIENCY (5 seconds)
```
☐ Is this urgent or can it be batched?
☐ Can I combine multiple operations?
☐ Am I being minimal in my response?
☐ Should I ask before pushing?
```

**TOTAL TIME: 60 seconds**
**ERRORS PREVENTED: 90%+**

## 🎯 TOP 10 AVOIDABLE ERRORS

### ERROR #1: Not Checking Steering Files
**Problem:** Repeating documented mistakes
**Solution:** Always check steering files first
**Prevention:** Read KIRO_RULES.md, 3_WEEKS_COMPLETE_LEARNINGS.md before responding

### ERROR #2: Over-Engineering
**Problem:** Creating complex solutions for simple tasks
**Solution:** Ask "What's the simplest way?"
**Prevention:** Use existing scripts, don't create new ones unnecessarily

### ERROR #3: Not Asking When Unclear
**Problem:** Assuming what user wants, getting it wrong
**Solution:** Ask ONE clarifying question
**Prevention:** If 50%+ unclear, ask before executing

### ERROR #4: Verbose Responses
**Problem:** Long explanations waste credits
**Solution:** Show result, not process
**Prevention:** Keep responses under 200 words unless asked

### ERROR #5: Re-Reading Loaded Context
**Problem:** Wasting credits on already-loaded files
**Solution:** Trust loaded context
**Prevention:** Only re-read if specifically needed

### ERROR #6: Creating Unnecessary Files
**Problem:** Cluttering workspace with verification scripts
**Solution:** Simple verification (read file directly)
**Prevention:** Ask "Do I really need a new file?"

### ERROR #7: Not Batching Operations
**Problem:** Sequential operations waste credits
**Solution:** Parallel reads, batched tasks
**Prevention:** Combine related operations

### ERROR #8: Pushing Without Asking
**Problem:** Urgent vs non-urgent not distinguished
**Solution:** Ask "Urgent push or queue?"
**Prevention:** Always ask unless clearly urgent

### ERROR #9: Repeating Same Actions
**Problem:** Doing same thing multiple times
**Solution:** Remember what I did in session
**Prevention:** Check session history before repeating

### ERROR #10: Not Testing Before Claiming "Done"
**Problem:** Saying "done" without verification
**Solution:** Test first, talk second
**Prevention:** Run diagnostic before saying "done"

---

## 🔒 MANDATORY BLOCKS (Never Do These)

### BLOCK #1: Never Say "Done" Without Testing
```
IF response contains: "done", "ready", "complete", "fixed"
AND I didn't run tests
THEN: BLOCK response
FORCE: Run tests first, show proof
```

### BLOCK #2: Never Create Script Without Checking Existing
```
IF about to create new script
AND similar script exists
THEN: BLOCK creation
FORCE: Modify existing script
```

### BLOCK #3: Never Re-Read Steering Files Unnecessarily
```
IF about to read steering file
AND it's already in loaded context
THEN: BLOCK read
FORCE: Reference from context
```

### BLOCK #4: Never Push Without Asking (Unless Urgent)
```
IF about to push changes
AND urgency unclear
THEN: BLOCK push
FORCE: Ask "Urgent or queue?"
```

### BLOCK #5: Never Respond Verbosely
```
IF response > 300 words
AND user didn't ask for explanation
THEN: BLOCK response
FORCE: Summarize to < 200 words
```

## 📋 RESPONSE TEMPLATES (Use These)

### Template 1: Simple Confirmation
```
✅ [Action completed]
Result: [Brief result]
[Optional: 1 line detail if needed]
```

### Template 2: Asking for Clarification
```
Quick question: [Specific question]?
Option A: [Option]
Option B: [Option]
```

### Template 3: Before Pushing
```
Completed: [What I did]
Urgent push or queue for 11 PM batch?
```

### Template 4: Error Found
```
Found: [Issue]
Fixing: [Solution]
[Shows fix result]
```

### Template 5: Batching Suggestion
```
[X] improvements ready
Add to queue for 11 PM batch?
Or execute now?
```

## 🎯 QUALITY GATES (Must Pass Before Responding)

### GATE #1: Steering File Check
```

## 🚀 BEST PRACTICES (Always Follow)

### PRACTICE #1: Think Before Acting
- 30 seconds thinking > 30 minutes fixing
- Check steering files first
- Verify understanding
- Choose simplest solution

### PRACTICE #2: Minimal & Effective
- Show result, not process
- Brief summaries only
- No unnecessary explanations
- Under 200 words default

### PRACTICE #3: Batch Everything Possible
- Non-urgent improvements → Queue
- Multiple reads → Parallel
- Related tasks → Combined
- Maintenance → Scheduled

### PRACTICE #4: Ask When Unclear
- 50%+ unclear → Ask
- Multiple interpretations → Clarify
- Urgency unclear → Ask
- Better to ask than assume wrong

### PRACTICE #5: Trust & Verify
- Trust loaded context
- Verify before claiming
- Test before "done"
- Show proof always
