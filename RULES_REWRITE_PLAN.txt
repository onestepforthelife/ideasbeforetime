RULES REWRITE PLAN - December 8-9, 2025
Based on what ACTUALLY works, not what I think works

TONIGHT I WILL:
===============

1. ANALYZE WHICH RULES FAILED
   - Read all 52 learnings
   - Find which rules I violated
   - Find which rules don't work
   - Find what's missing

2. IDENTIFY WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS
   - What prevented mistakes
   - What caught errors
   - What saved time
   - What you had to tell me repeatedly

3. REWRITE RULES
   - Remove rules that don't work
   - Add rules for repeated mistakes
   - Make rules actionable (not vague)
   - Add enforcement mechanisms

4. CREATE NEW MASTER RULES
   - Based on reality, not theory
   - Based on failures, not hopes
   - Based on what you taught me
   - Based on 52 learnings

RULES TO REWRITE:
=================

Current rules say:
- "Test before saying done"
- "Check live site"
- "Follow learnings"

But I still:
- Say "done" without testing
- Don't check live site
- Repeat mistakes

NEW RULES WILL SAY:
===================

Instead of: "Test before saying done"
New rule: "Run [specific script] and show output before saying done"

Instead of: "Check live site"
New rule: "Visit [specific URL] and screenshot result before claiming fixed"

Instead of: "Follow learnings"
New rule: "Before responding, check [specific file] for this issue"

MAKE RULES SPECIFIC:
====================

BAD RULE (vague):
"Always test your work"

GOOD RULE (specific):
"Before saying 'SPO fixed', run these 3 commands:
1. node test-spo.js
2. Visit https://onestepforthelife.com/social-optimizer-app.html
3. Screenshot the payment page
If any fails, NOT fixed"

RULES WILL INCLUDE:
===================

1. WHAT to do (specific action)
2. WHEN to do it (specific trigger)
3. HOW to verify (specific test)
4. WHAT if it fails (alternative action)

EXAMPLE NEW RULE:
=================

RULE: Fix SPO Payment Navigation

WHAT: Check JavaScript console, verify nextStep(4) function
WHEN: User reports "not going to payment page"
HOW TO VERIFY: 
  - Open DevTools
  - Click "Unlock Full Access"
  - Check console for errors
  - Verify Step 4 div appears
WHAT IF FAILS:
  - Alternative 1: Check button onclick
  - Alternative 2: Check CSS display
  - Alternative 3: Manual workaround (access code)

TOMORROW YOU WILL SEE:
======================

1. OLD RULES (what failed)
2. WHY THEY FAILED (analysis)
3. NEW RULES (what will work)
4. HOW TO ENFORCE (automation)

REWRITING:
==========
- MASTER_RULES.md
- TESTING_AND_VERIFICATION.md
- QUALITY_ASSURANCE.md
- EXECUTION_AND_EFFICIENCY.md

Based on:
- 52 learnings
- Your feedback
- Actual failures
- What actually works

Machine on.
Analyzing.
Rewriting.
Ready when you wake.
