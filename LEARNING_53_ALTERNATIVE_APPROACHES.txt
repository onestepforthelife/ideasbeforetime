LEARNING #53: ALTERNATIVE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
December 8, 2025

PROBLEM: Old approaches keep failing
SOLUTION: Include alternative methods for each issue

==============================================================================
PRINCIPLE: If Method A fails, have Method B and C ready
==============================================================================

FOR EACH ISSUE, PROVIDE:
========================

1. PRIMARY FIX (What I think will work)
2. ALTERNATIVE FIX 1 (If primary fails)
3. ALTERNATIVE FIX 2 (If both fail)
4. MANUAL WORKAROUND (Always works, user does it)

EXAMPLE - SPO PAYMENT NAVIGATION:
=================================

PRIMARY FIX:
- Check JavaScript console for errors
- Fix the error
- Test on live site

ALTERNATIVE FIX 1 (If no JS errors):
- Check if button onclick is correct
- Verify nextStep(4) function exists
- Add console.log to debug

ALTERNATIVE FIX 2 (If function works but step doesn't show):
- Check CSS display properties
- Verify Step 4 div exists
- Check z-index conflicts

MANUAL WORKAROUND (Always works):
- User uses access code: RECRUITER2025
- Or contacts: onestepforthelife@gmail.com
- Gets instant access

==============================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS:
==============================================================================

OLD APPROACH:
- Try one fix
- If it fails, stuck
- User frustrated
- No progress

NEW APPROACH:
- Try primary fix
- If fails, try alternative 1
- If fails, try alternative 2
- If all fail, manual workaround
- Always have next step

==============================================================================
TEMPLATE FOR TOMORROW'S PLAN:
==============================================================================

ISSUE: [Description]

ROOT CAUSE: [What I think is wrong]

PRIMARY FIX:
- Step 1: [Action]
- Step 2: [Action]
- Test: [How to verify]
- Time: [Estimate]

ALTERNATIVE FIX 1 (If primary fails):
- Step 1: [Different approach]
- Step 2: [Different approach]
- Test: [How to verify]
- Time: [Estimate]

ALTERNATIVE FIX 2 (If both fail):
- Step 1: [Third approach]
- Step 2: [Third approach]
- Test: [How to verify]
- Time: [Estimate]

MANUAL WORKAROUND (Always works):
- What user can do themselves
- No code changes needed
- Immediate solution

==============================================================================
COMMITMENT:
==============================================================================

Tomorrow's plan will include:
- 3 fix approaches for each issue
- 1 manual workaround for each issue
- Clear test for each approach
- Time estimate for each

If primary fails → Try alternative 1
If that fails → Try alternative 2
If all fail → Manual workaround
Never stuck, always have next step
