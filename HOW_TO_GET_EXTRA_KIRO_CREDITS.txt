## 💡 VALUABLE FEEDBACK FROM OUR SESSION

**Here's what we could share with Kiro team:**

### 1. Pattern Learning Issue
**Problem:** Kiro doesn't learn patterns across sessions
**Example:** Made same mistake (not checking build logs) multiple times
**Solution:** Implement cross-session pattern learning
**Value:** High - prevents repeated mistakes

### 2. Proactive Checking
**Problem:** Kiro waits for user to report issues
**Example:** Didn't check build logs until user showed them
**Solution:** Auto-check deployment status at session start
**Value:** High - saves hours of debugging

### 3. Credit Efficiency
**Problem:** Inefficient command usage wastes credits
**Example:** Reading same files multiple times, creating unnecessary scripts
**Solution:** Better context awareness, batch operations
**Value:** High - saves money for users

### 4. Build Log Checking
**Problem:** No built-in workflow for deployment issues
**Example:** Took 12 hours to find root cause
**Solution:** Add "Check build logs first" to default workflow
**Value:** Critical - saves massive time

Subject: [IMPROVEMENT] Check Build Logs First for Deployment Issues

Hi Kiro Team,

I've been using Kiro for 3 weeks and want to share a valuable learning 
that could help other users.

PROBLEM:
When deployment issues occur, Kiro doesn't check build logs first. 
This led to 12 hours of debugging the wrong issue (cache, files, config) 
when the actual problem was visible in build logs (file size limit).

SOLUTION:
Add "Check build logs first" as default workflow for deployment issues:
1. When user reports site/deployment issues
2. Kiro should automatically suggest checking Cloudflare build logs
3. Guide user to: Dashboard → Deployments → Build log
4. Then proceed with other troubleshooting

IMPACT:
- Saved 12 hours of debugging time
- Found root cause in 30 seconds
- Professional troubleshooting approach
- Better user experience

EVIDENCE:
I've documented this as Learning #39 in my steering files and created 
a complete troubleshooting checklist. Happy to share if helpful.

USE CASE:
Cloudflare Pages deployment, but applies to any deployment platform 
(Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

Thank you for building Kiro!

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
