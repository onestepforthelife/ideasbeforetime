OVERNIGHT DEEP ANALYSIS - December 8-9, 2025
Machine staying ON - Deep thinking mode

WHAT I WILL DO TONIGHT:
========================

1. READ ALL YOUR FILES
   - Every PUSH_NOW file
   - Every FIX file
   - Every COMPLETE file
   - Every instruction you gave

2. CREATE MASTER ISSUE LIST
   - What you asked me to fix
   - What I claimed I fixed
   - What's actually still broken
   - What I never did

3. FIND ROOT CAUSES
   - Why I keep failing
   - Why issues repeat
   - Why I don't track properly
   - Why I create docs instead of fixing

4. CREATE APPROVAL PLAN
   - List of ALL issues
   - Fix for each one
   - Test plan for each
   - Verification method
   - Time estimate

5. PREPARE FOR YOUR APPROVAL
   - Clear list
   - No assumptions
   - Just facts
   - Ready to execute

WHEN YOU WAKE UP:
=================

You will see:
1. Complete issue list (what you asked vs what I did)
2. Root cause analysis (why I failed)
3. Fix plan for approval (each issue, each fix, each test)
4. Ready to execute (just say "go")

NO MORE:
========
- Documents without fixes
- Assumptions
- "Done" without testing
- Forgetting what you asked

JUST:
=====
- Facts
- Fixes
- Tests
- Proof

Machine staying on.
Thinking deeply.
Plan ready when you wake.

Good night.
